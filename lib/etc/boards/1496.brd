I said I would give you a prize.

your prize
give me a type of item
I don't want to hear details of how good you want it, If I hear it I will 
not make an item even remotely like that KIND of weapon.

then give me a description of it's appearance, in once sentence.
like "A silver hammer lies on the ground, it's etched runes glowing softly"

Give me the name of the item
"a Runed Silver Hammer"

and then give me a good story of why this item would be good for your character.
Not a story of how you obtained it. "I was cooking a burrito and this silver hammer fell
out of the sky and said 'You must use me and be powerful!'"

If you want to associate this item with your past, you must include any NPCs. Descibe
the evil priest you stole it from. Describe what you did to get the chieftan to give
you the toothpick of shiny teeth. 

Also include what is happening now in relatin to your item. The evil priest has sent
his acolyte to retrieve the item and steal your soul.


This item should give me a way to create adventures relating to it, and give you
a way to make your character unique in personality, not just fighting monsters.

now that we all have our historys up...
We can start stating our opinions about them.

Like this:
Ravonous's history is more like a book describing some things he's done.
But it does not describe what he is like. Or what his emotions and urges are.

Those sorts of things, I think, are what help everyone in roleplaying.

Ravs journal rough draft, by jib.
Buying this parchment from Saduka could have been the best thing I have ever
purchased.  Having the ability to speak to someone, anyone, even if it is
myself through ink.  I have been lost in these woods for nearly two months.  
I only packed enough supplies to last me the trip which was supposed to only
take two weeks.  Being raise as a slave and later turned into the standing of
a gladiator at age 12 I have the ability hold my own, but woods, woods I know
very little about.  I am taking this all very well I suppose, trying to learn
new skills that enhance my persona as a warrior.  For instance being able to
track animals that have trailed down this path hours before I, the art of fire
building is no longer a mistery to me, but damned if I have figuired out how
to cook worth a damn.  I just hope Jiberdi will just appear and get me out of
this mess.  Tomorrow I think I will try to head towards that wisp of smoke
growing from the woods to the north, its too small to be coming from New
Haven, but perhaps someone there may be able to point me down the right path.
Picking up my camp, I set forth.  Not long into my trip this morning I came up
on a massive buck, several times larger than I have ever seen.  It would of
made a incredible feast, but I could not coax myself into slipping in behind
it for the kill, would have been to great a waste of such a superbly beautiful
animal just to fill my stomach for the night.  Although, later in the day I
did come apon a set of bear tracks that stroked my curiousity.  Considering
that they lead in the same direction, I followed.  Slipping through the brush
I came up just a few yards from the sleeping beasts.  I stood there observing
them for several moments, watching them roll about and belowing small grunts.
Just as my luck would have it, the slight breeze that continously blows
through the woods shifted and I retreated, for I know I stand no match for
them as soon as they catch my scent.  How bizzar!  I have reached the smoke,
but its source is still hidden from my eyes by the densness of jungle like
vines.  I tried to cut my way though, but the stranglers grew back almost
instantanously.  I have not seen such magic at work since my last meeting with
Jebidia.  I set camp for the night.  I have awaken to the bright sighting to
the sun peering through my blanket, which I have not seen the likes of in
weeks.  Pulling my head out further revealed to me that I was no longer in the
Emerald forest, but just on the fringe.  I made a quick snack ou out of my
last remaining rabbit and packed my gear.  While doing so I noticed several
trinkets and pieces of gold missing from my pack.  I have heard that many
thieves lurk within these woods, but do I sleep so deeply that one would be
able to steal my goods and still have time to move me out of the woods?  By
the time I gathered my composure, I started to hear a low bellowing noise
rising over the land.  Running in stride I came across the second hill to the
south.  In complete shock to see her sitting there in the distance, I sighed
in relief.  I found her.  I stand before the city of New Haven.  (from here I
go into some journeys of new haven adventures, meeting of jib and the reason
why rav joins jib in RR)

Emoka history draft 1
Emoka was a commander of an expiditionary group of murrash.  

They were set to look for Thadari relics, they did find one.  When the dust
settled Emoka was imprisoned by his sub commanders a small group of them
overthrew his command.  When they returned to the city Emoka was scheduled for
gladiatorial sacrafice, several of his wives were raped and sacraficed, the
others were kept as torture slaves by the sub commanders.  His children were
eaten by the sub commanders.  

Emoka escaped by surviving in the stomach of some big ass creature during the
gladiatorial sacrafice.  

Emoka wandered further and further away from Urlak.  Evenutally meeting a
group of outcasts like himself, he teamed up with them.  The Rough Riders they
called themselves.  After the group was nearly destroyed due to vile
treachery, Emoka decided to lie low.  Spiralus, an allie but not a direct
member of the rough rider advised Emoka on how to carry on the clan by
hisself.  

Offering his services as a mercenary, even giving mercenary tokens out so that
others could have them exchanged for mercenary work.  The plan was going well,
despite the lack of interest by anyone in mercenaries.

Rough Riders now...
We need to figure out some things then as matt posted.  Who are we and where
are we going.  

Who we are is kinda messed up, since there's still not ANY role playing
Spiralus is the leader, but is never around.  Think of him as the Professor X
who doesn't fight, but makes sure there's lots of cool shit in the Xavier
estate.  Spiralus is the only character in the Rough riders who would want to
have a dragon, or a jungle greenhouse or teleportation rings.  He's also very
savvy, he managed to get evidence to throw out all the mercenarys and TOOC
members from newhaven, if it were possible.  If you don't think he should be
leading then speak up.  And don't try to say Luke is a wussy because he wasn't
going to get his player deleted like yall ended up doing.  

Sooo.  We don't have a main goal right now for the Rough Riders.  That's
something all the characters have to discuss IC.  It would help if we liked
playing IC characters.  Perhaps we should practice playing IC more often.  

After we learn how to RP, and after a short term goal is made.  We should
assign tasks to everyone.  Like this person is responsible of espianoge, this
person for finding the secret caverns....  

So since yall will probably end up not doing any of this.  Here's the
assignment.  Since I've been working a lot on the clan, I think you guys
should try also.  

The assignment is this, I want a beleivable write up of your character.  
Don't say crap like, I spent 5 months killing gnolls in a lost tomb.  Talk
about your social life, the personal problems etc.  I want drama and
personality.  I want to know a lot more about your character.  And on top of
that, you have to write about yourself IC!  As if your character was writing
about themselves.    


And on top of that every rough rider member can tell someone else
to redo a post, if they tell them what they don't like about it.

No Subject
I am planning on putting a LOT of junk in that area, sorta like a store room
or armory.  Also having a shopkeeper so yall can buy potions scrolls and other
things that yall don't deserve to have free.  

I might put an addition into the training room such as a way to simply test a
skill There's a skillroll command that rolls the ability scores and the skill.


Eventually I plan to have a workshop so that players can create objects using
skills like carpentry blacksmithing and other shit.  

In regards to your first post...  

First off, Spiralus did found the rough riders, he acted like a scientist
needing mercenarys to help him in his quests.  He didn't boss anyone around
and had fun with yall.  But since everyone in the first ground died, excluding
Cedar who did die in real life and now has that bug where you can't remake a
character and keep it.  (grumble grumble) Spiralus also died later on.  He
also has the same problem with the die and remake bug.  

Darkfire and you were fun to play with, but when I logged on as my imm and saw
other imms getting ready to start fucking with you just cause, ( I never got
any explanation why) So I logged on as emoka trying to get yall to not get
yourselves killed by some pissed off imms.  I failed and was the only
remaining rough rider.  

So I played emoka for a few MONTHS by myself, I acted the part of the only
rough rider left alive.  I had an idea for the mud and Spiralus became and NPC
and would author some books he made describing the mud's stuff.  So I figure,
Spiralus can play the master whatever, give out ideas and pretend to be
leader, and the real players can work together however they like.  Also
Spiralus managed to steal the body of the framed dwomax who was killed in
Newhaven.  He found a priest to speak with his spirit and has information that
could cause a lot of people to want to kill us to keep us quiet.  So Spiralus
is basically in hiding for damn good reason.  

If there's something you disagree with how I am RPing Spiralus.  Argue it with
Spiralus RPwise.  

If you wish to talk with spiralus RPwise make a post.  I will try to make a
Spiralus MOB I can switch with to do whatever RP you guys want to do.    

Siddhatima AKA luke AKA Spiralus AKA Cedar AKA Emoka

HEY!
Again, I would like to know how you consider yourself founder and owner, but I do agree you should be leader due to the fact you are the only surviving member and we wouldnt know RP wise that you just run and hide for years.
I would just like to state that I am level 220, my old character used to be the man, so I want to be called the war chief or some shiat. We need to start a fresh new rp story line in which to follow. I will do something on wordpad and
e-mail it to Luke for some editting then final draft will ship and we can go off of that for future rp'ing. I do beleive that when more than one is on we should do some cool rp'ing towards some type of goal.
If your by yourself do what you like, but be weirry of some clan members other than RR who are out to get us and if you don't beleive me, then you weren't around for the great RR war, but then again either was Luke :)
I think in my draft I will come up with some Rank system just for the hell of it and no new person can be admitted without a complete vote. 
Thats all for now, Later.

Rough Riders
It is I, Spiralus, your mentor.  

After working for several months, the team of workers of several races has
completed the initial foundations of your new clanhall.  The magical
teleportation rings, the unusual flying ship Halcyon, the golem sparring
dummies, and the rejuvenation garden.  All are the results of serious research
and expensive needs, I hope you can use them wisely and in the most helpful
manner.  It must be known that none who are not rough riders may be admitted.
If someone needs assistance, you must find a way to give it to them
indepenantly on your own.  

It must also me restated, that no rough riders may instigate warfare with
others unless the entire clan has been able to decide on whether to do it, and
also they must agree on how.  We have lost many members in the past because of
impulsive fights with those more powerful than us.  

If you choose to go ahead after a city or a clan on your own, you will be
expelled from the clan.  We cannot endanger ourselves because of a single
person.    

Spiralus, the Founder and Owner of the Rough Rider's Clan.
