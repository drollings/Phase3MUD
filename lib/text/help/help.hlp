"COMBAT POSTURE"

Usage:  combat posture <posture>

The combat posture influences what kind of moves the player prefers in combat.
A player going all-out on their attack will not even attempt to defend
themselves; they will devote all their energy to offense, and get double the
normal number of attacks.  On the other hand, a player with an evasive posture
will not attempt an attack, but focus solely on avoiding harm to their person.

A normal posture focuses equally on offense and defense, so the postures may
be thought of in this context:

  DEFENSE  <-  evasive defensive normal offensive all-out  ->  OFFENSE

Choose your posture according to your character's style and circumstance.

FEINT

Usage:  Set in combat profile.

A feint is a diversionary attack, an attempt to "fake out" the opponent,
putting them off-guard and allowing better chances for the actual attack. 
If the feint succeeds, the attacker performs an actual attack with a +2 to
succeed, and the target loses 2 points of speed in their defense because of
their distraction.

"COMBAT SYSTEM"

The clashing of swords, the dueling reflexes; combat training is essential for
survival in the world of Ramas.  Combat takes place on a round-by-round basis;
each combatant gets a number of combat moves based on their dexterity,
encumbrance (hence also strength), and weapon.  Choice of weapons is dictated
by the style of combat and the nature of the foe.  Targets with little or no
armor may be felled with a well-placed dagger, whereas one will require a 
heavy weapon to deal with a well-armored foe.

An attack in combat is performed in the following sequence:

Whether by explicit command or by an automatic move from the &cWcombat profile&c0,
someone attacks their chosen foe.  They roll against their skill on three
six-sided dice; if they succeed, this means that the attack will indeed strike
the foe if not stopped.  

There are multiple layers of defense for the foe:

1)  Active Defense.  This involves dodging, blocking, parrying, etc.  The foe
may actively defend a set number of times per round, determined by their speed
and posture.  However, this defense may be exhausted by heated combat or even
neglected voluntarily - a skilled warrior  may block several sword thrusts, but
if greatly outnumbered, only their armor may save them.  If the active defense
fails, the attack strikes a specific location of the target's body, where armor
can offer further defense.

2)  Passive Defense.  This is the ability of armor to deflect  damage
harmlessly off its surface, without even absorbing the force of the blow.

3)  Damage Resistance.  This is the last line of defense, relying on the 
strength of armor or even the toughness of one's own body.  

Any damage that gets past these three defenses is dealt to the target.  Turns
are granted to each of the combatants, based on their agility and numerous
other factors.

"COMBAT POSTURE"

Usage:  combat posture <posture>

The combat posture influences what kind of moves the player prefers in combat.
A player going all-out on their attack will not even attempt to defend
themselves; they will devote all their energy to offense, and get double the
normal number of attacks.  On the other hand, a player with an evasive posture
will not attempt an attack, but focus solely on avoiding harm to their person.

A normal posture focuses equally on offense and defense, so the postures may
be thought of in this context:

  DEFENSE  <-  defensive evasive normal offensive all-out  ->  OFFENSE

"COMBAT PROFILE"

The combat profile is a list of moves in combat that are automatically
performed by the player.  The moves may be offensive or defensive in nature;
they are executed as needed from the top down.  The combat profile may be
overridden by manual commands; manually performed moves will drain off speed
points from the profile, meaning that fewer, if any moves will then be
performed automatically.

For example, here's how the following profile will perform:

&cR1&cr)&cW  right swing&c0          Combat begins.  The player performs an offensive
&cR2&cr)&cY  right parry&c0          move; the profile starts at the top of the list, and
&cR3&cr)&cY  dodge&c0                finds an offensive move there.  The player swings 
&cR4&cr)&cW  left thrust&c0          whatever weapon they may have in their right hand.
&cR5&cr)&cL  none&c0
&cR6&cr)&cL  none&c0                 The foe gets their turn.  They successfully attack
&cR7&cr)&cL  none&c0                 and the player must defend.  The combat profile 
&cR8&cr)&cL  none&c0                 starts at the top looking for defenses, and finds one
                         in slot two.  The player attempts to parry with 
whatever weapon they may have in their right hand.  Another enemy jumps in,
and the player needs to defend again; this time they execute their third move,
and attempt to dodge aside.

The round ends, the next begins.  We'll say that the player, due to agility,
gets two attacks this round.  They left off with their right swing last round,
so the profile searches from that point and finds a left thrust in slot four.
The player swings whatever weapon they have there... oops!  No weapon!  They
wound up punching.

The player gets their second attack.  Searching down, the profile finds no
further moves, so it starts back up at the top.  It's another right swing.

We'll say that the player's foes are similarly charged, and the player faces
two swings from one and a thrust from the other.  The player will attempt a
right parry, dodge, and another right parry, in that order.

DAMAGE

There are three basic types of damage:  basic, slashing, and piercing. They
differ in how much they harm the target, once armor is penetrated; slashing
damage does half again the normal damage, and piercing damage does double
because of the shock value.

This makes choice of weapons significant.  A mace and a dagger represent
opposite ends of the spectrum; a swing with a mace does large amounts of basic
damage, giving it greater chances to penetrate armor, while a thrust with a
dagger does less damage, but whatever damage gets through the armor is
doubled.

Choose axes, maces, and polearms, and similar when dealing with heavily
armored targets, and shortswords and daggers when dealing with light ones.  A
long sword represents an attractive middle point between these two opposites.

PRAY

For the clerically ordained, this offers a way to appeal to the deities for
aid.  Prayers do not drain mana; rather, they draw off of the skill in the
sphere from which they are derived, which can be shown on the "spells" screen.
When drained, the gifts of power over these spheres may restored to full
strength at the shrine of a deity or through a holy object, provided that the
player maintains their alignment with their deity.

CONCENTRATE

Usage:  concentrate	           <- Status display

Some spells stay in effect, requiring the continued attention of the caster
and continuously draining their mana.  The concentrate command allows the mage
to manage the spells they have in effect.

AIM

Usage:  aim <target's name> [ <direction> ]
        aim <target's name>

Aiming is the first step in typical ranged combat.  The command is issued in
the following format:

  aim <name> <direction>

...Thus, i.e.  "aim guard north" would target a guard to the north.  The target
is typically found using the "scan" or "look <direction>" commands, although 
aim can be used upon someone present in the same room as the player using the
format:

  aim <name>
  
After a brief wait, the target is acquired and objects may be thrown or shot
at the target.  If the target moves out of range, the player must pursue
in order to attack their acquired target.

BASH

Usage:  bash [target] or set in combat profile

Speed: 10

A bashing attack attempts to knock the target over.  Success is affected by
the weight of the attacker and target, and the heavier of the two will have an
advantage.  If the attack succeeds, the victim will be knocked to the ground;
otherwise, the attacker will themselves tumble to the ground and be unable to
attack.

A shield may be worn and used for the "shield bash", which enhances both the 
chance of success and the damage of a bashing attack.

While in combat, the target is assumed to be the character's opponent if not 
specified.

"COLOR CODES"

You can change the color of your text inline in says, gossip, titles,
descriptions, and just about anywhere else with a simple color code.  The
codes are used as follows:

Type &^cX where X is a letter from the following table, as per the given
color:

   &cL&^cL  Dark Grey                      &cB&^cB  Blue
   &cR&^cR  Red                            &cM&^cM  Magenta

   &cY&^cY  Brown                          &cW&^cW  Light Grey

&c0To use boldface, simply capitalize the color letter, as in &^cC for
&cCBright Cyan.&c0  Background colors can be altered by using a &^bX
sequence.  And better yet:

   &^co  Foreground color off           &^b0  Background color off
   &cv&^cv  Reverse video  &c0                &cf&^cf  Flashing text&c0
   &^c0  All color off

The most common use for this, of course, is custom colors for communication.

strength of armor or even the toughness of one's own body.  

Any damage that gets past these three defenses is dealt to the target.  Turns
are granted to each of the combatants, based on their agility and numerous
other factors.

"COMBAT POSTURE"

Usage:  combat posture <posture>

The combat posture influences what kind of moves the player prefers in combat.
A player going all-out on their attack will not even attempt to defend
themselves; they will devote all their energy to offense, and get double the
normal number of attacks.  On the other hand, a player with an evasive posture
will not attempt an attack, but focus solely on avoiding harm to their person.

A normal posture focuses equally on offense and defense, so the postures may
be thought of in this context:

  DEFENSE  <-  evasive defensive normal offensive all-out  ->  OFFENSE

Choose your posture according to your character's style and circumstance.

"COMBAT PROFILE"

The combat profile is a list of moves in combat that are automatically
performed by the player.  The moves may be offensive or defensive in nature;
they are executed as needed from the top down.  The combat profile may be
overridden by manual commands; manually performed moves will drain off speed
points from the profile, meaning that fewer, if any moves will then be
performed automatically.

For example, here's how the following profile will perform:

&cR1&cr)&cW  right swing&c0          Combat begins.  The player performs an offensive
&cR2&cr)&cY  right parry&c0          move; the profile starts at the top of the list, and
&cR3&cr)&cY  dodge&c0                finds an offensive move there.  The player swings 
&cR4&cr)&cW  left thrust&c0          whatever weapon they may have in their right hand.
&cR5&cr)&cL  none&c0
&cR6&cr)&cL  none&c0                 The foe gets their turn.  They successfully attack
&cR7&cr)&cL  none&c0                 and the player must defend.  The combat profile 
&cR8&cr)&cL  none&c0                 starts at the top looking for defenses, and finds one
                         in slot two.  The player attempts to parry with 
whatever weapon they may have in their right hand.  Another enemy jumps in,
and the player needs to defend again; this time they execute their third move,
and attempt to dodge aside.

The round ends, the next begins.  We'll say that the player, due to agility,
gets two attacks this round.  They left off with their right swing last round,
so the profile searches from that point and finds a left thrust in slot four.
The player swings whatever weapon they have there... oops!  No weapon!  They
wound up punching.

The player gets their second attack.  Searching down, the profile finds no
further moves, so it starts back up at the top.  It's another right swing.

We'll say that the player's foes are similarly charged, and the player faces
two swings from one and a thrust from the other.  The player will attempt a
right parry, dodge, and another right parry, in that order.

DAMAGE

There are three basic types of damage:  basic, slashing, and piercing. They
differ in how much they harm the target, once armor is penetrated; slashing
damage does half again the normal damage, and piercing damage does double
because of the shock value.

This makes choice of weapons significant.  A mace and a dagger represent
opposite ends of the spectrum; a swing with a mace does large amounts of basic
damage, giving it greater chances to penetrate armor, while a thrust with a
dagger does less damage, but whatever damage gets through the armor is
doubled.

Choose axes, maces, and polearms, and similar when dealing with heavily
armored targets, and shortswords and daggers when dealing with light ones.  A
long sword represents an attractive middle point between these two opposites.

CONCENTRATE

Usage:  concentrate	           <- Status display
        concentrate break portal   <- Breaks a portal spell in effect

Some spells stay in effect, requiring the continued attention of the caster
and continuously draining their mana.  The concentrate command allows the mage
to manage the spells they have in effect.
#0
CONSIDER

Usage:  consider <target>

A wise warrior always carefully considers his or her foe before entering
combat.  This command will compare your total point value with that of the
target's. You will receive a rough estimate of their toughness in combat,
which is by no means exact.  Point value may or may not be relevant to actual
difficulty in combat.
#0
DISARM

Usage:  disarm <target>

This difficult move will, if successful, deprive an opponent of their weapon.
The attacker's skill in the disarm move is rolled in a contest with the
target's combat technique to determine the outcome.
#0
DISMOUNT

Usage:  dismount

This is used to get off steeds and objects, of course.

See also:  MOUNT
#0
MOUNT

Usage:  mount <target>

You attempt to mount the target, if indeed it is a steed you can ride.  If so,
you must pass a riding check - a roll versus your riding skill modified by the
disposition of the mount.  Failure will leave you sitting on your posterior
for a bit.
#0
DOUSE

Usage:  douse <target>

This provides a means of turning off a light source, which is a wise thing to
do if the light source is unnecessary.  Many light sources have limited 
lifespans, after which they burn out.
#0
DRAW

Usage:  draw <target>
        draw
	
If you have a weapon in a scabbard, this allows you to quickly draw it for
use.  You can draw whatever may come to hand quickest (allowing the MUD to
choose for you) or you may specify what you wish to draw.

EMOTE CODES

You can also tailor your emotes for more detail with ` codes, followed
by the intended person's name, as follows:

                     Target       Bystanders         
Code     Example     sees         see
------------------------------------------------
`t       `tsomeone   you          someone 
`z       `zsomeone   your	  someone's

`e       `esomeone   you          he/she/it
`m       `esomeone   you          him/her/it

Some examples:

emote thinks `tMourn should give `zZhoern sword back to `mZhoern.

Mourn sees:  Tuathra thinks you should give Zhoern's sword back to him.
Zhoern sees:  Tuathra thinks Mourn should give your sword back to you.
Bystanders see:  Tuathra thinks Mourn should give Zhoern's sword back to him.

You can also refer to objects with # codes:

FLIP

Usage:  flip <target>,
        flip

Speed: 10

The flip move attempts to land a foe on their back on the ground.  It will
stun them briefly, preventing them from fighting.  If it fails, the attacker
will be vulnerable for nearly two rounds of combat.

While in combat, the target is assumed to be the character's opponent if not 
specified.
#0
FLY

Usage:  fly

If you happen to have wings, you can fly or walk to get to your destination.
While flying, fewer movement points are consumed, allowing faster movement;
however, because of the demands on your metabolism, your food requirements will 
be much higher than usual.

#0
GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP all
	GROUP front
	GROUP back

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player> adds
or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is following
you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters within the group.  Experience points will only be shared among group
members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing blow. 
Points are shared regardless of  participation in the fight, and are allocated
according to the point values of the members, the more powerful members
getting larger portions of the share.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group must
then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should NOT
follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for each
player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader should
remember to include himself in the group.

Once grouped, you can position yourself in the front or the back of the 
group, using the "group front" or "group back" commands.  See the section
on group positions for further details.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

"GROUP POSITIONS"

The choice of position within a group has many ramifications.  Those in the
back are more protected, provided that someone is in the front.

People in the front of the group may intercept melee attacks aimed at people
in the back of the group, provided that they either are not fighting or are
successful in a combat technique roll.

However, due to their reach, ranged weapons, polearms, and many spells
are not subject to interception, and will likely strike their target.  However,
the groupmembers in the back may employ those same weapons to attack while
taking cover behind the ranks in the front.

Spellcasters, thieves, archers, and those with polearms may prefer the back
ranks, whereas fencers and warriors are ideal for the front, especially if
they have good armor.

Note that polearms may not be used by someone in the back of one group to
attack a target in the back of another group.  The range is too high.
#0
HEADBUTT

Speed:  8

When all else fails, use your head!  The headbutt move is an attempt to damage
and stun the opponent by bashing one's skull against them.  Damage is enhanced
by wearing a sturdy helmet, and enhanced further by spiked helms.

However, should much damage be done with a headbutt, the target and victim
will both have to make constitution rolls to avoid being stunned by the
pounding headache that will ensue!  The rolls are modified by the damage
resistance of armor and hides involved.
#0
HIDE

When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room. If hidden
you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell. Even if sensed your
identity will remain hidden. Hide is broken by pressing return, regardless
of whether you typed a command or not.

Hide can also be used to hide objects in rooms.  The object must start in
your inventory, and must be able to be dropped.  The object can then only be
found by someone who knows it's there or has found it by searching the room.

Example:

  > hide
  Ok.
  >  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

  >  (You pressed enter and no longer hide)

or

  > hide note
#0
IRONFIST, "IRON FIST"

Speed:  4

The iron fist is a punching move employed by the warrior monks.  The damage is
greatly increased over the regular punch.

Because it belongs to a barehanded fighting form, wielding a weapon greatly
reduces the chance of success.  The higher the skill, the higher the damage
done.
#0
PRACTICE PRACTISE

Usage: practice [skill or spell name]

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills.  You can only do
so in your guild, where your guildmaster can help you train.  Type
"practice <skill>" to improve your abilities while in your guild.  You can
only practice a certain amount for each level you gain.  Unused practice
sessions will accumulate for use in future levels.

If you type practice anywhere other than in your guild, you will get a list
of all of the spells and skills you know and your level of proficiency at
each.

The practice screen displays skills in the format:

&cWSkill                        Base             Pts Mod  Proficiency
&cL-------------------------------------------------------------------
&cckick                         &cB[STR DEX       ]&cG   2  -1 &cy[&cm********&cb--&cy]&c0

This display, for example, shows that kick is rolled versus the average of the
character's strength and dexterity, that the character has invested two
practice sessions in the skill, that the skill roll has a modifier of -1
(actually an improvement over the default of -3), and finally, the overall
proficiency is rated by the bar graph.

When a guildmaster is in the room, the bar graph does not appear; instead,
your actual skill as it would be rolled on three six-sided dice and the cost
in gold of further improvement are displayed instead.

SPELLS

This command shows a list of the magical spells and clerical prayers that the
character knows.  It is displayed in the following format:

&cWSpell                        Base                    Mod  Proficiency
&cL----------------------------------------------------------------------
&ccburning hands                &cBfire                     &cG-1  &cy[&cm**********&cm]

The Base is the skill that is rolled for success, and the Mod is the modifier
applied to reflect the difficulty of the spell.  The character's actual
proficiency is rated on the bar graph.
#0
SKILLINFO

Usage:  skillinfo <skill name>

This command displays basic information on a given skill or spell.  The
skill's prerequisites and defaults are displayed, along with a graph showing
how proficiency will rise with practice.

Example:  > skillinfo broadsword

&ccSkill : '&cGbroadsword&cc'  Base: &cYDEX
&ccDefault1: &cYdexterity   &ccMod: &cY-5
&ccDefault2: &cYshortsword  &ccMod: &cY-2
&ccDefault3: &cYbeamsword   &ccMod: &cY-3
&ccCost  Modifier  Chance
&cC    1       -2     11
    2       -1     12
    4        0     13
    8	     1     14
   16	     2     15
   24	     3     16
   32	     4     17
   40	     5     18&c0

The cost represents the total amount of practice points required to attain the
level of proficiency, the modifier shows the adjustment to the base, and the
chance shows the number that must be rolled at or under on three six-sided dice
to succeed.

SKILLS

Skills are the rating of what your character knows and is capable of.  Next to
stats, they are the most important attribute of a character.  Both players and
computer-controlled characters gain skills over time.

To actually determine a character's success at a skill, three six-sided dice
are rolled.  The character must roll a number at or under their level of
proficiency, so higher numbers mean higher chances.

Because Tower of the Lost Order does not rely on levels or classes to actually
define the character's potential skills, skills are defined by their
relationships to other skills instead.  A skill has several important
attributes:  a base, a modifier, prerequisites, and defaults.  The definitions
of these terms follow:

&cWBase&c0:  Each skill rolls versus a character's statistic, or an average of
several statistics.  Most combat skills are determined by dexterity, although
the average of strength and dexterity is also common.  Most intellectual and
magic skills have intelligence as their base.  Other skills rely on wisdom,
constitution, or charisma, as appropriate.

&cWModifier&c0:  The modifier is added to the base, determining the actual
chance of success, and usually reflecting both the difficulty of the skill and
the character's proficiency at it.

&cWPrerequisites&c0:  Some skills require a certain level of mastery in other
skills or possibly a certain score in statistic before they can be learned and
used.  All prerequisites must be satisfied in order to use the skill.

&cWDefaults&c0:  Once the skill's prerequisites are satisfied, the skill may
be used.  Defaults represent related skills that may give some knowledge about
the skill being rolled; i.e. knowing how to fight with a broadsword gives the
player some idea of how to use a shortsword.  Defaults have an additional
modifier, usually reflecting how much the default skill aids the present
skill.  

A typical roll would go like this:

Jalastra has an intelligence score of 12, and wishes to search.  She has three
practice points invested in her search skill, which gives her a modifier of -1.
Hence, she must actually roll 11 or less on three six-sided dice to succeed.

The character does not need to invest any points in the skill in order to
take advantage of default rolls.  When the skill is rolled, the MUD picks
the best case out of the possible rolls.  If one has 30 points invested in
one's shortsword skill and only 2 in one's broadsword skill, the MUD will
use their shortsword skill as a default when using a broadsword rather than
the broadsword skill because of sheer aptitude, even after the -2 modifier
is applied to the shortsword roll.
#0
SHEATH

Usage:  sheath [weapon] [scabbard]

Attempts to sheath a weapon in an appropriate empty scabbard.  If no weapon is
specified, the first weapon found in hand is assumed as the object.  The
equipment and inventory are then searched for the appropriate scabbard, wherein
the weapon is placed.
#0
FEINT

Usage:  Set in combat profile.

A feint is a diversionary attack, an attempt to "fake out" the opponent,
putting them off-guard and allowing better chances for the actual attack. 
If the feint succeeds, the attacker performs an actual attack with a +2 to
succeed, and the target loses 2 points of speed in their defense because of
their distraction.

HOUSE

The HOUSE command is used to add or remove guests from your house's guest
list.  You must be standing in your house to use this command.  Only the
primary owner of a house (not guests) may change the guest list using the
HOUSE command.

Usage: house [<player name>]

Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on
your house's guest list.  Typing 'house' with the name of a player will add
that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will
remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on the list.
The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

Guests of your house will be able to enter your house until you remove them
from the guest list.

See also: HOUSES

HOUSES

Houses have been implemented as of CircleMUD 3.0.  A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house and
quit; your objects will drop to the ground and be crash-saved for when you
return.  There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses; contact your local Implementor for
a fee schedule.

CIRCLEMUD CREDITS

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Gekke Eekhoorn, Jeff Fink, Chris Epler, Eric Green, and Chris Herringshaw,
     and Stefan Wasilewski for extensive beta-testing, bug reporting, and code
     submissions for Circle 3.0.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven, for porting the code to the Amiga.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions for Circle 2.x.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns, for allowing Circle to exist at JHU CS.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted code, areas,
utilities, suggestions, and otherwise supported CircleMUD in one way or
another.  I absolutely couldn't (and wouldn't) do this if it wasn't for all
of your help.  Thanks everyone!

enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  FLAG        MEANING

"COLOR CODES"

You can change the color of your text inline in says, gossip, titles,
descriptions, and just about anywhere else with a simple color code.  The
codes are used as follows:

Type &^cX where X is a letter from the following table, as per the given
color:

   &cL&^cL  Dark Grey                      &cB&^cB  Blue
   &cR&^cR  Red                            &cM&^cM  Magenta
   &cG&^cG  Green                          &cC&^cC  Cyan
   &cY&^cY  Brown                          &cW&^cW  Light Grey

&c0To use boldface, simply capitalize the color letter, as in &^cC for
&cCBright Cyan.&c0  Background colors can be altered by using a &^bX
sequence.  And better yet:

   &^co  Foreground color off           &^b0  Background color off
   &cv&^cv  Reverse video  &c0                &cf&^cf  Flashing text&c0
   &^c0  All color off

The most common use for this, of course, is custom colors for communication.
A good example for this is the following command:  "alias ' '&^cG$*".

Finally, if you wish to echo a "&^c" to the screen, type "&^^c".
#0
PRACTICE PRACTISE

Usage: practice [skill or spell name]

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills.  You can only do
so in your guild, where your guildmaster can help you train.  Type
"practice <skill>" to improve your abilities while in your guild.  You can
only practice a certain amount for each level you gain.  Unused practice
sessions will accumulate for use in future levels.

If you type practice anywhere other than in your guild, you will get a list
of all of the spells and skills you know and your level of proficiency at
each.

#0
CONSIDER

Usage:  consider <target>

A wise warrior always carefully considers his or her foe before entering
combat.  This command will compare your total point value with that of the
target's. You will receive a rough estimate of their toughness in combat,
which is by no means exact.  Point value may or may not be relevant to actual
difficulty in combat.
#0
DISMOUNT

Usage:  dismount

This is used to get off steeds and objects, of course.

See also:  MOUNT
#0
MOUNT

Usage:  mount <target>

You attempt to mount the target, if indeed it is a steed you can ride.  If so,
you must pass a riding check - a roll versus your riding skill modified by the
disposition of the mount.  Failure will leave you sitting on your posterior
for a bit.
#0
DOUSE

Usage:  douse <target>

This provides a means of turning off a light source, which is a wise thing to
do if the light source is unnecessary.  Many light sources have limited 
lifespans, after which they burn out.
#0
DRAW

Usage:  draw <target>
        draw
	
If you have a weapon in a scabbard, this allows you to quickly draw it for
use.  You can draw whatever may come to hand quickest (allowing the MUD to
choose for you) or you may specify what you wish to draw.

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

See also: OFFER RENT
#0
OFFER RENT

For use in the receptions of inns.

Offer makes the innkeeper tell you the cost of storing your belongings
for one day.  Rent stores you belongings and exits you from the game.
When you re-enter, you will start where you rented.

There is a daily charge for rent.  You may store your things at the
CRYOGENIC CENTER for a one-time charge of four days rent.  See INNS
for details on the rent policy.

DEITIES

Here are the spheres that each deity has an emphasis in.  Also listed are
spells that a cleric of that given deity will be able to cast at any time based
on a skillroll to ordination.  Note that the listed spheres show emphasis, but
do not exclude others.  You could have a cleric of Vaadh or Shestu receive
healing spells - but rarely, and only at the proper shrine.  On the other
hand,  Pelendra will have major emphasis on healing.

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a

yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be eihter a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.
#0

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

lifespans, after which they burn out.
#0
SHEATH

Usage:  sheath [weapon] [scabbard]

Attempts to sheath a weapon in an appropriate empty scabbard.  If no weapon is
specified, the first weapon found in hand is assumed as the object.  The
equipment and inventory are then searched for the appropriate scabbard, wherein
the weapon is placed.
#0
SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

ALCHEMIST ALCHEMISTS

Alchemists study the physical aspects of spells and gain their powers
through the combination of spell components. They are very secretive
about the components needed to cast their special spells and no scrolls
dealing with this are known to exist. It is known that every alchemist
spell requires at least three objects. When one component is in the 
alchemists inventory they will experience a certain physical effect, if
two, another effect, if all three, the magical powers of the alchemist and
his objects are released.

 Since the alchemist uses physical objects to cast their spells, they
require no mana, and are the most powerful of any type magics.

attack.

A shield may be worn and used for the "shield bash", which enhances both the 
chance of success and the damage of a bashing attack.

BERSERK
In ancient times, warriors of some clans would go through extensive measures 
before battles to create a frenzy like state where they would know no fear and
do massive damage.  Be it through intense mental preperation, or with
the aid of amphetamines and other such agents, the results of their berserker
state were more than apparent on the battlefield.

Berserk is a skill warriors have in which they must perform BEFORE a fight is
in progress.  By using this skill, the warrior goes into a series of preper-
atory steps in which they reach a frenzy like state.  There are a number of
effects.

1.  The warrior's ability to damage, his effective strength and hardiness are
    significantly increased.
2.  The warrior's intelligence and wisdom are likewise decreased.
3.  The warrior is considerably resilient to effects which would disable the
    opponnent through pain or fear.
4.  The warrior is unable to flee or show similar acts of cowardice or mercy.

The berserker rage induced by the warrior's actions has a limited duration of
effect, which is determined by if the warrior is fighting, and how long the
warrior has kept his berserker state.  After the berserk 'loses' his rage, his
mental faculties will be restored, but his physical ones will be exhausted by
his effort.

HEADBUTT

Speed:  8

When all else fails, use your head!  The headbutt move is an attempt to damage
and stun the opponent by bashing one's skull against them.  Damage is enhanced
by wearing a sturdy helmet, and enhanced further by spiked helms.

However, should much damage be done with a headbutt, the target and victim
will both have to make constitution rolls to avoid being stunned by the
pounding headache that will ensue!  The rolls are modified by the damage
resistance of armor and hides involved.
#0
HIDE

When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room. If hidden
you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell. Even if sensed your

of whether you typed a command or not.

Hide can also be used to hide objects in rooms.  The object must start in
your inventory, and must be able to be dropped.  The object can then only be
found by someone who knows it's there or has found it by searching the room.

Example:

  > hide
  Ok.
  >  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

  >  (You pressed enter and no longer hide)

or

  > hide note
#0
IRONFIST, "IRON FIST"

Speed:  4

The iron fist is a punching move employed by the warrior monks.  The damage is
greatly increased over the regular punch.

Because it belongs to a barehanded fighting form, wielding a weapon greatly
reduces the chance of success.  The higher the skill, the higher the damage
done.
#0
PRACTICE PRACTISE

Usage: practice [skill or spell name]

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills.  You can only do
so in your guild, where your guildmaster can help you train.  Type
"practice <skill>" to improve your abilities while in your guild.  You can
only practice a certain amount for each level you gain.  Unused practice
sessions will accumulate for use in future levels.

If you type practice anywhere other than in your guild, you will get a list
of all of the spells and skills you know and your level of proficiency at
each.

The practice screen displays skills in the format:

&cWSkill                        Base             Pts Mod  Proficiency
&cL-------------------------------------------------------------------
&cckick                         &cB[STR DEX       ]&cG   2  -1 &cy[&cm********&cb--&cy]&c0

This display, for example, shows that kick is rolled versus the average of the
character's strength and dexterity, that the character has invested two
practice sessions in the skill, that the skill roll has a modifier of -1
(actually an improvement over the default of -3), and finally, the overall
proficiency is rated by the bar graph.

When a guildmaster is in the room, the bar graph does not appear; instead,
your actual skill as it would be rolled on three six-sided dice and the cost
in gold of further improvement are displayed instead.

SPELLS

This command shows a list of the magical spells and clerical prayers that the
character knows.  It is displayed in the following format:

&cWSpell                        Base                    Mod  Proficiency
&cL----------------------------------------------------------------------
&ccburning hands                &cBfire                     &cG-1  &cy[&cm**********&cy]
&cccharm                        &cBpsyche                   &cG-2  &cy[&cm********&cb--&cy]
&ccchill touch                  &cBwater                    &cG-2  &cy[&cm********&cb--&cy]
&ccportal                       &cBvim                      &cG-4  &cy[&cm********&cb--&cy]&c0

The Base is the skill that is rolled for success, and the Mod is the modifier
applied to reflect the difficulty of the spell.  The character's actual
proficiency is rated on the bar graph.
#0
SKILLS

Skills are the rating of what your character knows and is capable of.  Next to
stats, they are the most important attribute of a character.  Both players and
computer-controlled characters gain skills over time through usage.

Because Tower of the Lost Order does not rely strictly on class or level to
define a character's abilities, skills and the attributes they rely on are the
most definitive aspects of a character.

Skills are gained by studying their prerequisites.  There are various branching
hierarchies that encompass the skills of archetypical classes such as warriors,
mages, and clerics.

See also:  SKILLINFO, "SKILL DETAILS"
#0
SKILLINFO

Usage:  skillinfo <skill name>

This command displays basic information on a given skill or spell.  The
skill's prerequisites and defaults are displayed, along with a graph showing
how proficiency will rise with practice.

Example:  > skillinfo broadsword

&ccSkill : '&cGbroadsword&cc'  Base: &cYDEX
&ccDefault1: &cYdexterity   &ccMod: &cY-5
&ccDefault2: &cYshortsword  &ccMod: &cY-2
&ccDefault3: &cYbeamsword   &ccMod: &cY-3
&ccCost  Modifier  Chance
&cC    1       -2     11
    2       -1     12
    4        0     13
    8	     1     14
   16	     2     15
   24	     3     16
   32	     4     17
   40	     5     18&c0

The cost represents the total amount of practice points required to attain the
level of proficiency, the modifier shows the adjustment to the base, and the
chance shows the number that must be rolled at or under on three six-sided dice
to succeed.

"SKILL DETAILS"

To actually determine a character's success at a skill, three six-sided dice
are rolled.  The character must roll a number at or under their level of
proficiency, so higher numbers mean higher chances.

Because Tower of the Lost Order does not rely on levels or classes to actually
define the character's potential skills, skills are defined by their
relationships to other skills instead.  A skill has several important
attributes:  a base, a modifier, prerequisites, and defaults.  The definitions
of these terms follow:

&cWBase&c0:  Each skill rolls versus a character's statistic, or an average of
several statistics.  Most combat skills are determined by dexterity, although
the average of strength and dexterity is also common.  Most intellectual and
magic skills have intelligence as their base.  Other skills rely on wisdom,
constitution, or charisma, as appropriate.

&cWModifier&c0:  The modifier is added to the base, determining the actual
chance of success, and usually reflecting both the difficulty of the skill and
the character's proficiency at it.

&cWPrerequisites&c0:  Some skills require a certain level of mastery in other
skills or possibly a certain score in statistic before they can be learned and
used.  All prerequisites must be satisfied in order to use the skill.

&cWDefaults&c0:  Once the skill's prerequisites are satisfied, the skill may
be used.  Defaults represent related skills that may give some knowledge about
the skill being rolled; i.e. knowing how to fight with a broadsword gives the
player some idea of how to use a shortsword.  Defaults have an additional
modifier, usually reflecting how much the default skill aids the present
skill.  

A typical roll would go like this:

Jalastra has an intelligence score of 12, and wishes to search.  She has three
practice points invested in her search skill, which gives her a modifier of -1.
Hence, she must actually roll 11 or less on three six-sided dice to succeed.

The character does not need to invest any points in the skill in order to
take advantage of default rolls.  When the skill is rolled, the MUD picks
the best case out of the possible rolls.  If one has 30 points invested in
one's shortsword skill and only 2 in one's broadsword skill, the MUD will
use their shortsword skill as a default when using a broadsword rather than
the broadsword skill because of sheer aptitude, even after the -2 modifier
is applied to the shortsword roll.
#0
FLIP

Usage:  flip <target>,
        flip

Speed: 10

The flip move attempts to land a foe on their back on the ground.  It will
stun them briefly, preventing them from fighting.  If it fails, the attacker
will be vulnerable for nearly two rounds of combat.

While in combat, the target is assumed to be the character's opponent if not 
specified.
#0
FLY

Usage:  fly

If you happen to have wings, you can fly or walk to get to your destination.
While flying, fewer movement points are consumed, allowing faster movement;
however, because of the demands on your metabolism, your food requirements will 
be much higher than usual.

CAMOFLAGUE

When you type camoflague there is a chance you can blend in with your
surroundings. If camoflagued you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life"
spell.  Even if sensed your identity will remain hidden.  Camoflague is
broken by pressing return, regardless of whether you typed a command or
not.

SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

  > socials

"EMOTE CODES"

You can also tailor your emotes for more detail with ` codes, followed
by the intended person's name, as follows:

                     Target       Bystanders         
Code     Example     sees         see
------------------------------------------------
`t       `tsomeone   you          someone 
`z       `zsomeone   your	  someone's

`e       `esomeone   you          he/she/it
`m       `esomeone   you          him/her/it

Some examples:

emote thinks `tMourn should give `zZhoern sword back to `mZhoern.

Mourn sees:  Tuathra thinks you should give Zhoern's sword back to him.
Zhoern sees:  Tuathra thinks Mourn should give your sword back to you.
Bystanders see:  Tuathra thinks Mourn should give Zhoern's sword back to him.

You can also refer to objects with # codes:

! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:

> tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

AFK

This command flags you as Away From Keyboard.  This does not protect you
in any way, it simply lets other players know that you are not there to
respond.  Typing afk again or any other valid command removes the flag.

#0
ALIAS ALIASES

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

> alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overriden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

> alias gbb get bread bag
> alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

> alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

> alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.  For example:

> alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
> killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

> alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

> alias tr tell rasmussen $*
> tr hi there, how are you today?
You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

ANSI COLOR

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

> color off
This command disables all color.

> color sparse
> color normal
> color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

ASSIST

Usage: ASSIST [ <person in need> ]

If Quifael is being beaten senseless by a warg and you feel brave enough
to help him, type ASSIST QUIFAEL to hit the warg.  Note that the warg will
keep hitting Quifael; assist only makes you start to fight whomever is
attacking the person you're trying to assist.  Assist with no arguments will
assist the first person (starting with the leader) in your group who is
fighting.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

This command toggles whether or not you see your communication echoed
back to you (i.e., from commands such as SAY, SHOUT, HOLLER, etc.)
Useful if you have a slow connection or if it just annoys you.

"PREF SHOUT"

SHOUT toggles whether or not you hear shouts.  (deaf) will appear after
your name in the WHO list.

"PREF SUMMON"

Due to problems we've had with players killing other players by summoning
them to Bad Places, all characters now have SUMMON PROTECTION turned on by
default.  This prevents people from summoning you and gives you a warning
message if someone tries.  If you want to let someone summon you (i.e. if
someone wants to summon you for a legitamate reason), type NOSUMMON to turn
off summon protection.  You can then type NOSUMMON again to turn protection
back on.
#0
"PREF TELL"

Use PREF TELL if you wish to prevent other players from using "tell" to
communicate with you.  (notell) will appear after your name in the WHO
list if you have notell on.

"PREF PAGELENGTH" PAGER

The pager causes a page break and a prompt to continue to be inserted long
output.  This command allows you to change or see how large the page size is.
Pagelength followed by a number sets the length of a page to that number of
lines.  Pagelength default sets the pager to the default number of lines on
a typical screen.  Pagelength off disables the pager.  Typing pagelength by
itself will display the current setting. 
#0
QUEST

This simple toggle command merely informs the Powers that Be that you
wish to particpate in the currently running Quest.  If an immortal
is running a Quest and needs to know who wishes to participate, he/she
will ask players to turn on their Quest flags using this QUEST command
if they are interested in the Quest.  It also allows you to listen in on
the quest channel and receive information specific to the quest.

QUIT

When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'.
Note that quitting this way causes any items you might be carrying to
simply be left on the ground.  If you wish to have your equipment stored,
you'll have to find an inn and pay rent.

#0
SAVE

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

#0
TIME

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#0
TOGGLE

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the MUD.
This command CAN NOT be used to change these values (see related commands.)
All of these toggles remain the same until you change them; i.e. they are
saved when you quit or rent.
