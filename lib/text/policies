Primary Rules for LexiMUD:

1. Bug the Admin Frequently for New Rules

Punishment for these offenses can range from warnings to banning and
everything in between, to be determined by a Security or Admin present.
Also, we take action and ask questions later, so you have been warned!

Remember, ignorance of the law is no excuse!
