We have now implemented a system of semi-permanent death.  

In a nutshell, combat is fought to victory, not necessarily death.  However,
pick your fights wisely.  Death will leave your character feeling...  
non-corporeal.  Needless to say, development of clerics is now in progress.  

Enjoy!

random disconnects we have seen.  The web page will be pointed to the
current address, and updates posted there.  Stay tuned!
