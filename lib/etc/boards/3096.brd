I'm gonna mail another, smaller letter with Mckenna and 1 or 2 other pics,
plus some money to ship the stuff back, and some for Garadon's scanning
assistance.  

G if you want to add me to your livejournal account, you could see my MSN
webpage and that it has a upload file section where anyone can upload.  It
also has the mud pics from a year ago.  

Also Casual James, G, and Nestor, could I get your ICQ authorization?  My UIN

Re: previous, light bulbs go off
Dude!  We have VMWare.  Regarding the above, we have an instant X client
that we could use.  All you have to do is run VMWare on any Windows platform
and have it boot a Linux kernel configured as in that article.  This may
be VMWare, but the requirements of the virtual machine would be minimal.

Of course, we could just find a good X solution for Windows.  Those usually
cost money, but the effect would be the same.

Nate, you gotta check this.
Here we have simple instructions on the setup of an X terminal.  Quite
cool, having it laid out that easily.

Oh dear.
I got a huge kick out of The Onion's "What do you think?  " this week, about
the WWII memorial...  

"I'm not convinced what they did is so great.  I made it to the end of Castle
Wolfenstein in like, two hours.  "

Oh man.  :)

I love Idaho
Only in Idaho can you lose your parents because they are feeding you lilypads
and pond stuff.  Seems like this family in Bonners Ferry just an hour north of
where I used to live, was living off lilypads and lakewater.  Badass I say,
except the dad died from malnurishment, and the cops threw the mom in the
nuthouse on the day of the funeral.  It's ironic since she was paranoid that
they would do just that to her.  Anyhow the kids seem to be taking it well,
they've been keeping themselves busy with shooting at cops trying to take them
away and eating lilypads.  I'm getting in line as an adoptive parent.  I ain't
missing my chance to have in my family kids already gun trained.  

Siddhatima - is wondering how the hell you cook a lilypad...

Updates
Well, my Richmond saga continues.  Last Wednesday I concluded my previous 
contract successfully (anyone who goes into consulting, remember to finish
each job with a bang!) and took off to Florida for my brother's graduation
from New College.  Details have already been posted at
www.livejournal.com/users/abstractform/ for that particular trip.  I had
a marvelous time. :)

So, I'm back in Richmond; I've been hired for up to three weeks to assist
in the transfer of more Nortel-related data.  The pay is decent, but it's
very much on my mind to further my education, so I'm planning on returning
to the area when this job is up to go back to school and show calculus what
for.  They're going to put me in an apartment in a couple days, and a
hotel room in the intermediate time.  I intend to come down this next weekend
to hang out if possible.

Take care, people.

Enter the dumbass, stage right
For days, I have struggled to explain to someone that the TCP/IP protocol does
not give ownership information or geographical location - in vain.  The
presence of optional SNMP features that give some identification on a small
fraction of my data had him convinced that if he talked at me enough, sent me
on enough wild goose chases, that I'd suddenly say, "Oh, you mean this data!
" and hand it to him.  

So, for days we've gone in this cycle.  "These IP ranges belong to X assets.
What do you have that falls within these ranges?  " "Here they are.  " "Are
these X assets?  " "These are the IP ranges you provided...  "

Bleh!  Anyone have some live chickens?  We should all meet at some crossroads
and offer sacrifices by the light of the full moon until the spirits of
assinine management are pleased!

Funny as shit!
This is just too much.

For a decade, there's been a spec for internet protocol using live carriers
over a 3D medium to implement a point to point protocol.  It's scalable,
has inherent packet collision avoidance, and persistent retry until the 
carrier drops.  In other words, homing pigeons.

Now, as if my day wasn't silly enough already... ;)

Something dirty this way comes...
So, I'm workin.  And we get to the commerical break.  While they sqwak at
everyone else over the headsets, I'm watching mah little TV, cuz the
Teleprompter for the Fox43 news show is in the WAVY set, not the Fox set.  (I
dunno).  But there's this commerical for Best Buy, showing people how they can
test out stuff at their show.  Then they compare it to other stores.  Like a
hardware store.  LIke the toilet section of a hardware store.  Some dude was
testing out toilets.  Awwwwww!

Re: Thus spake the camel
	------- Quoted message -------
I was reading the glossary of "Programming Perl" and found the following
definitions:

LAZINESS:  The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce oveall
energy expenditure.  It makes you write labor-saving programs that other
people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't 
have to answer so many questions about it.  Hence, the first great virtue
of a programmer.  Also hence, this book.  See also impatience and
hubris.

IMPATIENCE:  The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy.  This makes
you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually 
anticipate them.  Or at least that pretend to.  Hence, the second great
virtue of a programmer.

HUBRIS:  Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for.  Also the
quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people
won't want to say bad things about.  Hence, the third great virtue of a
programmer.

As I sit here watching my Perl scripts chug through my SQL database, 
generating reports on hundreds of thousands of records, I can only say 
"isn't that the truth!" ;)

Game this weekend
is difficult at best. Its Easter Weekend, and I got family coming in.
Well, one person, really. But its enough to make the rents turn me into
the enslaved mexican. I could probably throw something together, but the
party isn't exactly in a position to easily encounter other people. (They're
SOL right now). However, since its easter weekend, that means the mexican
grill will be fired up and used. Lots of food, come as you will (or wont).

My coworker just wandered over, looked at my screen...

"my ($i, $dbh, $sth).... How do you keep track of all that stuff in your 
head?", he asked, as he gaped fishlike at the Perl code on my screen.

"Deep concentration, lots of comments, and consistent data structures to 
allow for reuse of existing code", I replied.

He wandered meekly back to his seat.  The quiet is utter bliss.

how the major banks are doing, and "oh wow there's SQL in this Access query".

I get the impression...
...that l33t speak got started when some kid looked over someone's shoulder
while they were hex-editing. ;)

Speaking of, a friend of ours was just fighting off the l33t h@x0rs the
other day.  The Bajcsi noticed trouble with the DNS server and rebuilt it,
only to find the problem cropping up again.  It turned out that someone had
hacked in and replaced the DNS daemon with an insecure version.

An insecure DNS server is the spawn of hell.  You can execute code inserted
into buffer overflows, transfer files, you name it.  Suffice it to say,
a secured BSD box is there where the old server used to be.

I just watched a guy waste a half hour of my teams' time today trying to
figure out what I could have told them in five seconds if they had understood
what a parent directory was and how an FTP site works.  Further, if there's
any justice, I want automatic rights to mute my teammate.  He talks and talks
and has only half a clue about anything outside of Office.  I'd as soon
let my child play on a crowded freeway as turn these two loose on a

that they shouldn't have to a folder where they have no delete access.

V-Day
Actually, my understanding is that there is an actual Saint Valentine.
Now, my understanding is probably flawed, but as I am given to know,
his story is that he broke his monk's vows to run off with not one but
TWO married women, and subsequently these two women found that they
could not cohabitate with the "Saint" and both ran off and killed
themselves.  Very romantic, neh?
