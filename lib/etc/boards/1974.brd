Nor do I...  I was just commenting on the irony of those three numbers being
the post number, in this instance.  Cowinkydink.

831
I'd always heard it as 831.  8 letters, 3 words, 1 meaning.  Bah, still rather
silly if you ask me.  I don't need a set of numbers to convey that.

I always thought the 143=iloveyou code was dumb.  I can think of *NUMEROUS*
phrases that can fit the one letter word four letter word three letter word
description.  Not all of them nice.

143
is pager code for "I Love You."

One-letter word, four-letter word, three-letter word.  Ask someone,
it's pretty universal.  And the poem is about the act of jumping off
the emotional precipice and saying "I love you," not knowing what they
may do or say in reaction.

Freefall
FREEFALL

Such a small word
To hold such power over me
And now spoken
My heart is afraid
She threw herself off the mountain
She is falling through the clouds
Waiting for wings
Clutching at the wind
She has her eyes shut tight
To capture the illusion of flight
Because sometimes
Belief is enough
So perhaps in this total surrender
To your beautiful gravity
I can fall all the way
To the stars
From within your arms
They don't seem so far...





I suppose that I should post SOMETHING new so I shall
post my favorite of the new ones.  :)

AP Psych...
AP Psych might be cool. I thought AP European History ruled, however.
We got to make historical movies in the vein of Monty Python. Even had Crazy
Tetzel as a recurring character in our skits. Though my rendition of Sally
Struthers left much to be desired. James knows what I mean.

eh
I dunno if he defined achetypes, but defined an example of them. 

Perhaps he was agnostic or unique in his feelings, but he was great friends/coworkers
with a recently deceased anthropoligist who knew tons about religion influencing 
societies.I was perturbed by mag's choice of people to quote, no offense or anything
but there are better people to idealize.

mag, just take AP psych if they offer it, you don't need pre-requisites if you have
a good teacher.

re: Collective Unconscious
I just resently picked up "Basic Writings" of Jung and hadn't yet finished it. But I find the book Interesting, as well as anything about psychology.
I've really been thinking about taking 2 years of psychology while I am in high school, but I don't have many open electives.
I'd like to talk about pschology once I read more of it, and can grok it further.

Athiesm
Maybe he just didn't belive in there being any divinity.  No god is no god,
even if you do belive in some metaphysical force.  Or perhaps he belived that
we are divinity.

Collective Unconscious
If you have read Jung's theory on a Collective Unconscious then you may begin
to doubt whether he was or wasn't an athiest.  As his C.  U.  Idea is entirely
metaphysical, it fits the definition of metaphysical.  It also aligns itself
with nearly every recognized religion on earth.  

You should take AP psych in High School, I did and went on to take several
more psychology classes in college.  We discussed Jung and how he contradicts
himself in this very way.  Interesting stuff on both sides nonetheless, his
views on athiesm and on Collective Unconscious.    

We should talk psych sometime.

"Everyone who has his eyes and wits about him can see that the world is dead,
cold, and unending.  Never yet has he beheld a God, or even compelled to
require existence of such a God from evidence of his own senses.  "

Children of the Fatal

<Fithos Lusec Vecos Venosec>

Wake all  you from sleep, my children.
There are no nests/cradles(?).
Rise up all you from sleep, children of the fatal.
Do not go to sleep.
Rise up all.
To find the garden of  truth.
Burn to the truth.
Burn the bad of the world.
Burn to the truth.
Wake to endure the world.
Day of the fatal.

(Nota Bene-- There were many misspellings and missuses of the words  given to me.)

my first poem
Airplane flying high and bold 
Your aluminum body growing more and more cold
The passengers have poopse to be dumped
Into the loo and out the plane it gets pumped
The cold freezes it all to the plane very tight
Creating a gigantic and godawful sight
Occasionally turbulence is caused by a thermal
Breaking frozen chunks from the plane's epidermal
They fall to the ground with terrible speed
Noxious impacts their only purposfull deed
Destruction comes daily to many below them
From the sky's deadly rain of these ICBMs


This was from Antinomy (spelled appropriately)
and another compilation book I don't remember.
The poem is mine, but the pun is his, ICBM.
That's what I was yammering about in the last post

I'm really fucking sick
Of Beck and 311,

And what about Bush
And lame-ass Oasis?
Hey, talk about pretentious,
why don't they just blow England off the map?

I turn it on again
But it's plain to see that
The radio still sucks.

Addendum
Child, do you still believe in mercy?
      This world has fangs like you'd never know,
      but the mauling is for my good.  It teaches me to...
 
      to...
 
Scorched one, do you ever miss the light?
      I am a shell within a shell within a hard outer shell,
      And cinders at the core.  I sing no dirges.
 
Martyr, why do you still burn?
      Lacking reason, I go to extremes to find my meaning.
 
Prophet, what say you?
      Surely there was something written for times like this...
 
    Still trying to read the script?
    No wonder I never listen to you anymore.
 
Shadow, have you anything for me where I hang?
      Friend, my hands are empty...
 
    Sometimes there's no room for sacrifice.
 
There was another seat reserved
  ...but nobody ever took it.

...So, I wrote some bad poetry and then spent the evening going shopping.

Optimism
Optimism is nothing more,
than a blind illusion.
Such is a deceptive cure,
for those trapped in their desolution.
The lamenting who embrace it firmly,
are wrapped tightly in a  blanket of naivity.
Those despairing in a pessimistic void,
are blinded by the light of oblivion.
For the lighthearted apathetic mass,
it devotes them to a life of benevolence
to which they forget their lost life of loll calmness. 
Such things are  compared to nothing more
 than an empty bottle of limpid glass,
that is filled with a cloudy counterfeit nostrum.

Kiss of the Sky
i feel like a deer caught in the headlights
semi barreling down on me
nowhere to go
and no desire to do so
but what will happen to me?

unstoppable
yet i cannot acknowledge the truth
as the truth follows me

so i am hounded
and chased
pursued
and all the other things that mean hunted

for i am a fox amongst hounds
searching for some den
within the brambles
thick in the tangles
stung by the thorns of my aching soul

whose questions go unanswered
despite my screams to be heard
that only echo within
and fade away
in the morning light...

so i draw the most important things within
never to be seen
although i ache for release
and hunger for freedom
unable to express

can you see it in my eyes?
bars of a cage
and the heart's wings beat against it
frantic to fly
and promised to domestication
never to know the kiss of the sky again...

Hampden-Sydney Haiku
Ever been really, REALLY bored in a class that's far beneath you but that you
must take for your major?  I have, and this is what happens.  

  
Rough grit sandpaper
On dildo, no vaseline
Report cards arrived.

Hampden-Sydney claims,
Hate-fucked by garden weasel,
Yet one more victim.

An econ major
A small burrowing vermin
Forced in parts unknown.

All work and no play
The life of econ majors
Can't hardly stand it.

More as I get bored.

Manifest Abstracts
Every thought an apocalypse, 
  you brood patiently, watching 
  inevitability 
   creep up the 
    valleys, 

Painting sky and ground alike a lurid red. 
  Proud mountains become 
  simpering hills become 
  waning islands become 
  naught. 

It is a mighty force of nature that you 
 are born of, are absolutely at peace with 
 even as you supply it with its opposite. 
Like the consuming flood beneath, 
 you strike down great and humble alike; 
 you are manifest terror. 
I choose you to observe the closure of a cycle. 

You are not the destroyer here; you are its 
witness, setting seal to its proclamation, 
"Here lie all things deemed eternal!" 

The eyes of mortals race towards lies 
when they see things like these. 

You are legend, a survivor of more 
  terrible things than this, hence 
  a symbol of deeper things embedded, the 
 Beautiful wrathful monsters 
 inside us; never completely tamed. 
I sedate you at my peril. 

I have invested in you the power 
  symbols often attract; 
You are a sign that desolation can recede 
  leaving a wealth of hope 
 for the battered remainders... 

Here, we make a sacrament of abolishing miracles 
in favor of the pulse of life that pauses 
for lifetimes, then pounds again, renewing us 
in ways both wonderful and terrible. 
Patience, patience to all who watch with you. 

You are the courage to look for new roads, 
  to smite chains that bind us to old maps, 
  to leave in peace blind salesmen selling blindfolds; 
So comfortable! Half off today... 

Powerful abstracts sometimes take yet more surprising forms.

Banality
Lies whispered like murmurings
 of a serpent with a halo,
Lie spread like a rancid feast
 Before me, everyone just
All eyes for every way
 You think you were all
Justified.

But what dies with you then,
Finds its grave in me now.

It follows, then, that when you
  Alone are mystified when
Your own venom floods your veins, and
  All the banalities you spewed
  Return to you on their own terms...

I yet remain mute, needing no other voice.

Burial
I found that letter again today,
 Addressed to you,
 
I'm not claiming more eyes than you;
It helps nothing to play prophet.
I merely was rent from top to bottom
While you dipped one foot in the grey ...
 
I don't know if I should scream or pray
Over this, but everyone else is doing
Both already for me, in silly conniptions;
So certain that some angel or demon or
Subconscious connection dropped their shell game,
 
One boon of life I shall claim,
 That at my turn at the gate I shall leave
 

 No sister wondering who I was,
 No brother wondering why I was gone,
 No one writing angry letters at the
 
   *most inexplicable times*, 
 
  Filled with words
You and I should both understand.
 
...Liar.
 
You remain silent as ever.

or
Get On The Bus

If god is all knowing, can he know what he doesn't know?
He would not know nothing, so if he knew that, then he WOULD know nothing,
which is obviously not everything, but rather, nothing.

God is stupid.

Chapter 2

If god is everything, is god himself a dog?
Because a dog is not everything.
If god is a dog he is not everything.
If he is everything, he is more than a dog, so he is not a dog, so he is not everything.

God is a dog.

Chapter 3

If god can turn into anything, can he turn into a turd?
A turd can't turn into anything, so if god turned into a turd, he
wouldn't be able to turn into anything so he would be a turd and not god,
so god can't turn into a turd and be god so god can't 
turn into anything so god can't be god.

God is a turd, and you can't polish a turd.

Chapter 4

If god can do everything, he can do everything at once.
If he can do everything at once, he has to be doing nothing
since that is part of everything at once, so god would do nothing which
isn't everything so god can't do everything.

God is nothing.

Chapter 5

If god cannot be destroyed, and god can do anything, can god kill himself?
If he killed himself, then he could be destroyed and would
be dead and no more god.  If he couldn't he wouldn't
be able to do everything and wouldn't be god.

God is dead.  Dead is dead.  Parts is parts.  Dead gods is parts.

Humorous, if not my own creation
I awoke early one morning,
The earth lay cool and still
When suddenly a tiny bird
Perched on my window sill,
He sang a song so lovely
So carefree and so gay,
That slowly all my troubles
Began to slip away.

He sang of far off places
Of laughter and of fun,
It seemed his very trilling,
brought up the morning sun.
I stirred beneath the covers
Crept slowly out of bed,
Then gently shut the window
And crushed his fucking head.

I'm not a morning person

Ode to Gesticulation
I'm gonna wear my sweater backwards
To make a statement
To all of human kind
In order to make myself heard
By everyone who doean't want to listen
I will say every third word in French
I will compare poetry to childbirth
And wear flowers in my shoes
I will paint my face like the crow
'Cause man, that guy is DEEP
I will mock the establishment
By marking everything it stands for
And doing the exact opposite in rebellion
I wish people understood me
But they're to busy playing ball
Well, not me
Because I'm an individual

the wooden toy
                       1
The brightly-painted horse
Had a boy's face,
And four small wheels
Under his feet,
Plus a long string
To pull him by this way and that
Across the floor,
Should you care to.
A string in-waiting
That slipped away
In many wiles
From each and every try.
                       2
Knock and they'll answer,
Mother told me.
So I climbed four flights of stairs
And went in unannounced.
And found a small wooden toy
For the taking
In the ensuing emptiness
And the fading daylight
That still gives me a shudder
As if I held the key to mysteries in my hand.
                       3
Where's the Lost and Found Department,
And the quiet entry,
The undeveloped film
Of the few clear moments
Of our blurred lives?
Where's the drop of blood
And the teeny nail
That pricked my finger
As I bent down to touch the toy
And caught its eye?
                       4
Evening light,
Make me a Sunday
Go-to meeting shadow
For my toy.
My dearest memories are
Steep stair-wells
In dusty buildings
On dead-end streets,
Where I talk to the walls
And closed doors
As if they understood me.
                       5
The wooden toy sitting pretty.
No, quieter than that.
Like the sound of eyebrows
Raised by a villain
In a silent movie.
Psst, someone said behind my back.

someone else's poem
Had I known that the heart
breaks slowly, dismantling itself
into unrecognizable plots of misery,
Had I known the heart would leak, 
slobbering its sap, with a vulgar 
visibility, into the dressed-up 
dining rooms of strangers,
 
Had I known that solitude could 
stifle the breath, loosen the joint,
and force the tongue against the palate,
 
had i known that loneliness could 
keloid, winding itself around the 
body in an ominous and beautiful
cicatrix, 
 
Had I known yet I would have loved 
you, your brash and insolent beauty,
your heavy comedic face
and knowledge of sweet
delights,
  
But from a distance 
I would have left you whole and wholly
for the delectation of those who
wanted more and cared less.
