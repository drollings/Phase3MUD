No doubt!
I hear you man.  I've gone in between dealing with real life and burning out
while trying to get the MUD squared away where it can deal with all the
demands of its builders.  Coding technicalities aside, the two things I'm most
concerned with are getting the gaming system nailed down and streamlining the
building process.  

I'm still studying what it would take to get us switched to a Python core that
glues together our C++ code with SQL and XML elements.  I've not figured it
all out yet, but the outlook is good.  Python should finally free me from
having to redo the guts of the MUD to make the big ideas we have supported at
the core.  It should take over a lot from the DGScripts we have going that are
doing things that should be hardcoded.  

As for gameplay, we need to tune the skill learning process, and this has been
discussed.  Combat needs to be more interactive and flexible, and this has
been discussed.  We need more detailed zones and quests.  I don't mind that
magic is difficult, but it is a bit kludgy right now and needs a little
refinement.  I think it's a few steps shy of real greatness.  And then there
are the clerics and the in-depth skills for ranger/thief types; we've plans.
My big thing is making the environment more detailed and interactive, and what
we need to be able to do this is IMHO an object-oriented structure that allows
us to concentrate efforts on a few base rooms and objects and let the benefits
carry over to the rest of the MUD.  

I'm not really concerned by the criticism.  I know there are breaks in the
gameplay and that it's been an imm-only thing for a while.  I'm ready to do
my part to address this.

my appeal...
I love this mud

I have turned to it because my best friends are here and I had no better way
of finding them.  

But it needs improvement in order to become more appealing.  The mortals who I
play with are not impressed.  The immortals barely log in as a mort to enjoy
it's content.  

I am trying to do what I can to create a stimulating environment.  I have
created pictures to spark peoples imaginations.  There is also my work as a
builder.  But that alone is not enough to satisfy the players.  

The players say that the system is too difficult.  Magic is too hard to do,
experience is unrewarding, and skills are unfulfilling.  

I am posting this because I hope my observations and opinions count.  I want
to work on this Mud as much as anyone else, to the extent of my abilities.  

We need to re-ignite the mud of old in order to bring back the life this mud
once had.  I want to work for it, is anyone else with me?  

Siddhatima-I'm serious, I'd go to everyone's house to listen to them if I
could.  I know I'm not the best imm here but I want to work.

Starscape questions, sugguestions, and double checks.
Starscape Ships
So far it is my understanding that the ships will be mostly modular
in construction.  In this manner, when a ship is constructed, its hull type
would be the first thing decided.  Various hulls will allow for various
amounts of cago space, require different amounts of crew, contain no to many
fighters, allow for craft planet fall or require landing craft for planet
fall.  Each hull type would allow for varying armor ratings, engine ratings,
and have various numbers of hard and or firm points.  After construction,
players would be able to change their engine types, armor ratings, weapons
loadout, and sensors.  These changes should be reflected in the physical 
appearance of the ship, and should require a "dry dock" to do.
Starscape Planets
These should be presented as 2D height maps covered in a texture
appropriet for the overall conditions for the planet.  Things to consider,
weather, tectonics, oceans, indiginous life.  If the space combat engine 
makes use of a 2D plane, I highly recommend using almost the exact same 
system for surface combat, just with different vehicles.  Ideas for planets:
mines for a perpetual source of miners, colonies for tax income, forts for
political boundries, hubs for intersteller travel.
Starscape Intersteller Travel
Things to decide, medium of travel.  Worm holes, Hyperspace, Warp,
Solar sails?  Is IST instantaneous, does it take time, can it be interrupted?
If steller travel uses 2D can intersteller still use 3D?  What are means of
navigation, pulsars, black holes?  Reference points, up spin, down spin, 
coreward, outward?
Starscape ETs
Are there other intelligent races?  If so, can players be those races?
Are the races mixed, as in, would you find multiple races working on the same
ship, or would you only find races of like type on a given ship.  Is their tech
better, is it worse?  Are they hostile, are they friendly?  Is there just one
other race, or are there several?
Starflight Life
Are all players in starflight ship captains?  Are all these ships
merchants or pirates?  Can players be privateers or pirate hunters?  Can
players actually captain military vessels?  If there is a military, who are
they fighting, pirates, factions, other races?  Would an AI automaticly create
and distribute orders for these captains to go out and follow, giving them a
dead line to compleate their mission?

StarScape Project Guidelines v0.1
Starscape Project Guidelines
----------------------------
 
This document details my opinions (as of this writing) on the goals
of Starscape.  While I do not want to be a dictator and force my views
on the others participating int he development project, I do want to
lay down some rules for the game:
 
* Starscape is based on Elite, Star Control 2, Starflight, Trade Wars,
and other games of the genre.
    It it a slower paced game of strategy, planning, investment, and
diplomacy.  It is not a 'twitch' game.  Thus, reflexes should not
matter nearly as much as other games (such as Wing Commander, Quake,
Ultima Online).  Failure to act may have it's consequences, but a
lttle lag shouldn't hurt anyone.
 
Those rules said, let us continue with the plans!
 
 
1. Game Universe
   It is still relatively undecided as to how to handle the space
flight model.
    A fully 3D flight system would provide for realism at the
expense of controlability - it becomes harder to maneuver, control,
and navigate the ship.
   A 2D (flat plane of movement) system, whether with limited 3D
(ala Home World) or not, allows for much more concise control and
navigation.  It sacrifices realism in part; most planets lie on the
same plane, with occasional deviation, thus travel between locations
would essentially lie on the same plane anyways.
 
   Other things to consider: in a 3D world, collision is harder to
do (read: more CPU intensive).  It also becomes necessary.  However,
in a 2D plane of movement, anything but large ships could be made
to collide (smaller ships would assume to veer (up/down)... thus
newbies can't do damage ith new ships by collision.  Simple ordering
of drawing or changing the offsets could fix it.  Or, the ship could
be forced to adjust it's offset automatically.

Quick note...
I have successfully implemented safe pointers within the code of Phase 3.5.
It was based upon, but not directly copied from, code FearItself showed
me.  I felt, however, that we needed to have our own implementation.

What does this mean?  A safe pointer is automatically cleared when whatever
it points to is extracted from the game.  By converting such things as a 
character's pointer to the person they're fighting to safe pointers, we
eliminate many, many bugs.  We also make it much easier to have delayed
actions involving multiple characters and objects.

Chances are that this will eliminate any last vestige we have of the
shadowboxing bug.  It might miss bad handling of people being removed from 
rooms - but not from the game.

I like this kind of code. :)

------Reznor's Proposed Management Policy/Plan/Procedure/etc------
1.  Givens:
    a.  Change is inherently destructive.
    b.  Change is necessary to advance.
    c.  Stagnance is inherently destructive.
    d.  Stagnance allows comfort.
    e.  In the middle is the best place to be.
2.  History
    a.  In the past changes have been applied but not implemented.
    b.  Implementation requires application of the change and management to minimize impact.
    c.  Agendas have been made in an arbitrary fasion.
    d.  Many small changes are applied resulting in a constant state of change.
3.  Future
    a.  Changes need to be planed in full before coding, let alone compiling.
    b.  Agendas need to be made WITH A TIME FRAME.
    c.  Changes need to be weighed based on destruction vs construction.
    d.  As such, changes need to be manages to minimize impact and maximize effect.
4.  Proposition
    a.  Collect changes for a period of one month before application.  *While* awaiting
        these changes, impliment them.  Prepare builders/players for them.
    b.  Limit "phase" changing things to one a year.  These are the big hitters, and should
        incorporate multiple things.
5.  Effects
    a.  Using the above propositions, we have time to fully think out a change, code the change
        prepare people for the change, apply the change, and debug the change, before moving on
        to the next one.
    b.  Limiting "phase" changes to once a year will prevent things such as the huge impact of
        the Phase 2 move and subsequent large changes that resulted in re-building of things or
        neccessitated pearl scripts or such to alter existing information.
    c.  By preparing builders for these changes before hand, we can prevent the "shock" of
        having something they're used to using change.  It also allows for training in the use
        of new tools.
6.  Conclusion
    a.  This develops harmony between homiostasis and transiostasis.  Change with comfort.

Stuff
The whole coordinate system should have been discussed more...  Covertly.  
It's a huge change and everyone thinks they know the best way to do it.  Too
many cooks in the kitchen.  There's a difference between brain storm and brain
flood.  The latter is bad.

Ultimately
After the email verification is in use, we will be able to list characters by
email address and we may even be able to record a history of IP addresses for
each email address.  Either way we'll be much more informed than we ever were
before.

Re: user database
Here's the story on it...

We have the email validation coded, but disabled.  We know that it works,
but this MUD's server needs to be reconfigured for it to be able to mail
the passwords to about 80% of the servers out there.

Beyond that, I haven't been pressed to develop this thing further.
You know me. :)

User Database
What ever happened to that project we were working on to
keep track of who logs in from where, who else they play
and who they are in real life?  We kinda did something
with it, but I'd like to keep working with it.

Interesting
When you load a player such as:
load player spam
then you bring into the game a linkless player
You can do all sorts of things with him that help us run the game.
What's the method that we're supposed to get rid of that player now?
We have a linkless player hanging about.
Do we force him to quit?  Purge him?
The interesting part was, I purged spam, as such, and all his eq
was lying in the room.  I thought, "Uh oh", and reloaded him.
When I loaded him again, he still had all his stuff on him, and now
a copy of all that stuff in the room.  Interesting.
My big question then is:  What's the best method for getting rid
of the loaded character and saving all the changes we've made to them?
force them to save and quit?

Hey Kenny!
I need your number.  I've apparently got an outdated one in my list.
Thanks!
