Hmmm...
Ok, how many people have this portable board? and if I write stuff in it, others can view it right? Well, info on my zmud map, I have all the roads, most of the mountains, and all the towns. I also color coded the paths to some of the zones
that do not have roads. I was thinking of color mapping the whole thing, green for the forests and grass, but feel the whole thing would be cluttered and might mess up the speedwalker setup.

virtual room templates
A single room formation can be duplicated in many different places.  If there
is a tabulator which keeps track of location of individuals in respective
template duplicate rooms.  The tabulator must also moderate the actions of the
virtual inhabitants.  

Combat, commands and socials are going to get complicated.  

The benifits of this are duplication of ships, houses, tunnels trees natural
formations, If the virtual room becomes streamlined, the entire world map can
be generated in high detail, or restricted to individual zones needing them.

conversation tree for mud
Following in the footsteps of the Ctree program for the opensource project of
Starcontrol TimeWarp found on the Free Starcontrol Webpage.  

I'm going to attempt to include conversation dialogues, dialects, and social
responses.  

Conversation dialogues follow a certian branching pattern, a single
postulation, followed by a selection of PC responses, each response can have
it's own new branch in the conversation, the progression can be detailed or
simple.  Dialect filters search the NPC lists and replace key words with the
local slang.  

Social responses, a large cross section of the population can be gathered.  
With a combination of actors and subjects.  When applied to an NPC it attaches
only certian triggers which apply to that individual.

additional ideas.
remove mass of venders and trader's market idea,
instead go with drunken duck and sawtooth dock
create dunes area and cliffside fir grove, use dungeon like terrain to simulate terrain.
or rather outdoors navigation.

have toll for horses, small amount to exit with a horse, equal amount to return with same type of horse
look to Gurps for horse variations, donkey etc

instead of gold have objects with weight and worth, ie furs
have an actual campsite with lightable fire and bedding
have rooms in tavern that all can access for free to encourage use
beds etc

have tavern at top of cliffs and if you bring things from the dock to the top you get paid to drop it off
stolen the objects are worthless, unless sold to other merchant.

Normally, the scope of a character's Influence is limited to their locale (e.g., the domain).
Thus, a character using Politics 8 to declare a state of emergency in a region could only do
so in their home domain. If a character has traveled to another domain and their Influences
have been checked in by the local Storyteller, then that character may use their Influences in
their present locale at 1.5 their normal cost (meaning that a Politics 8 action would require 12
unopposed actions from a non-local character). 
Characters can use their Influences to affect things outside of their home domain or even
outside of their home region. To affect domains outside of the character's current domain but
in the domain's region, the character must inform their home DST of their intent and spend
two times the normal cost to reach outside of their home domain. (Note this influence use as:
Reach beyond Domain in Region). Similarly, a character can affect areas outside their region
by spending five times the number of actions after informing their DST. The most serious
drawback of acting outside of your home domain or locale is time. The spent actions are
recorded by the character's home DST and reported to the RST. The RST then inform the
appropriate DST in the region or RST of a different region of the Influence expenditures by a
player outside their respective domains or regions. Thus, an action from one domain to
another in the same region will most likely take a full month. Actions between regions will most
likely take two full months. Clever players may be able to use this delay to their advantage. 
Characters may even be allowed to use their Influences to affect an entire region or a nation
all at once. With the appropriate approval via storyteller reports (Regional Storyteller for
regional, National Storyteller for national), a character may expend a great deal of Influence
to manifest their Influence regionally or nationally. Since region-wide and nation-wide
Influence attempts are made through the Domain storyteller (to the Regional Storyteller or
Master Storyteller via reports), the Domain Storyteller should act as a gate to help players
realize what actions are likely to be accepted region-wide or nation-wide. If the request to use
the influences region-wide or nation-wide is denied by the Storyteller in charge, the actions
spent are still lost. Characters with a 8-9 influence rating will have superior access to
region-wide resources and may be able to affect things inside the region or region-wide more
easily (e.g., at half cost for magnified actions listed in Laws of the Night: Revised pg
96-104, and half cost to affect the entire region). Characters with a rating of 10 may enjoy
this same privilege nationwide. These are at the discretion of the Regional Storyteller and
Master Storyteller respectively. 
Moving and Influence Location (4.5)
A character's Influences are located in their home Chapter or Domain. If that Chapter is
located say in San Francisco, then that character's influences are located in that area as
well. You may not have multiple influences of the same type located in different locations.
Example: Gary has a character that has Police 4 in San Francisco (his home Domain) and
wants Police in Fresno. He is politely informed by the Storyteller that he may not have a
separate Influence located in Fresno. 
With permission of the Storytellers, a Player may have his characters Influence in a different
geographical location. It requires the permission of the far away Chapter and Domain
Storytellers and both of the player's home Chapter and Domain Storyteller. 
If a player moves to another city, we do not want to penalize that player for using or having
influences. A player may have his character transfer his influences to that new location. It
takes one month to make the transfer at no loss of level or Growth banked. Have your old
Chapter Storyteller contact your new Chapter Storyteller with the character's Influence levels.

Analyze
Analyze actions give information about what general occurrences. Trace is about a specific
character's Influence; Analyze is about all characters' actions. This is a general expenditure
against everyone. You learn details first concerning yourself, such as if someone is Tracing
you or trying to Steal your influences. You must have expended a greater number of
Analyze actions than the number of Conceal actions to notice any attempts. Generally, it is
easier to learn about bigger actions than smaller ones. You may specify your Analyze to
narrow down what you wish to know. This will give you greater effect depending on your
Storyteller. 
Combine
Combine in used when two or more characters use their Influence together in order to
achieve a common goal. Working similar to Loan, the characters declare the primary action
and how many Combined actions are being applied to that action. For each individual
Combining their influences beyond the first character, there is a five action penalty cost.
Combining does not reveal Influences between characters, unlike Loan, which gives the
character to whom Influences are loaned an automatic Trace. 
Loan
Loan splits your Influences. When Loaning another player your Influences, only half of the
normal amount of actions you give them are available to the temporary owner. For example, if
Sandra Setite were to loan her Media 4 (10 actions) to Tina Toreador, Tina would only be
able to utilize 5 actions (10/2 = 5). In addition, this gives an automatic Trace from the loaner
to the recipient. In our above example, Tina would have a Trace on Sandra's Media
influences. 
The Scope of Influences; Cost Multipliers (4.4)
          Use while in home domain (Standard Cost) 
          Use while in another domain (1.5x Standard) 
          Influence another domain, in region (2x Standard) 
          Influence another domain, outside region (4x Standard) 
          Influence home region (5x Standard) 
          Influence another region (7x Standard) 
          Influence nation (10x Standard)

Block
Block actions prevent everyone from making specified Influence actions. It reduces all actions
of the type specified by the amount of actions invested in Block. For example: Clarice invests
3 actions to Block "get a Blood Trait" (as listed in the Health Influence). Now anyone that
month attempting to get blood has three actions subtracted from their action. If the adjusted
total is less than what is needed to achieve the effect, the effect fails. If more than one
character is investing in the same Block effect, the result is the effect of the highest Block
spent. To clarify, Block actions are not cumulative. Block is very powerful but specific. You
may not Block the following types of Actions: Expansion (STEAL and GIVE), Protection
(BLOCK, PROTECT and CONCEAL), Transformation (DESTROY, COMBINE and LOAN), and
Informative (TRACE and ANALYZE.) 
Protect
Protect actions maintain your assets. It prevents other characters from Destroying,
Traceing or Stealing your Influences. It protects all Influence of that type. For example,
placing 2 actions of Protection on your media influence protects all of your Media but does
nothing to protect your Health. Characters whose influences are between levels 1-3 are
automatically covered by the small-fry clause. This clause states that they are so small as to
have an automatic three actions of Protection. 
Protection reduces Steal, Destroyand Trace actions by twice the amount of Protection
actions. In the Media example above, the character who is defending placed 2 actions into
Protection. To successfully begin acquiring the Media Influence, the offensive player would
have to spend at least 5 actions (2X2=4, so 4 action penalty) toward Steal (assuming they
have the influence Traced. Since the offending character spent 6 actions toward Steal, it
would net her 1 Steal success out of the 15 needed. The next month, she still needs to
overcome any Protection actions (if the defending player kept it up). For her to Steal the
Influence in one month, she would need to invest 19 actions (4 + 15). 
Conceal
Conceal actions prevents Analyze from showing what actions you took. The minimum cost to
Conceal is the of the action being concealed. For example, Concealing a three point action
(like acquiring an SMG with Underworld) costs a minimum of three actions devoted to
Conceal as well as the three actions to merely accomplish the stated action. Conceal beats
Analyze if it is of a value equal to or greater than the Analyze. 
Trace
Trace actions are used to hunt down another character's Influence. You must Trace a
character's Influence before you can Steal or Destroy it. The character must spend a
number of unopposed Trace actions as the target has actions with the Influence (the larger
the Influence of the player you are Tracing, the more effort required). If you wanted to Trace
a character with Health 7, it would require 28 unopposed actions to map their little Influence
empire. This is not exact, but it gives you an idea of their Influence. Protect blocks Trace on
a one for two basis. Once another character's Influence has been Traced, it is easier to
Analyze that character's actions. A Trace may be lost at the Storyteller's discretion.

Special Actions (4.3)
Growth
Growth is used for increasing an Influence rating. A character must spend two times as
many unopposed actions of Growth as the new level of influence would allow. For example, if
a character with Media level 6 were using Growth to reach level 7, that character would have
to accumulate 56 Growth actions ((1 + 2 + ... + 7) * 2 = 56). This will usually take more than
one month, but Influence actions are banked. This allows characters to gradually work
towards higher levels. There may be additional requirements for achieving levels 8 - 10. 
Domain Storytellers can award Influence levels up to 7, Regional Storytellers can award
Influence levels 8 and 9, and the National Storyteller can award an Influence level of 10. You
may not bank growth past the level you need approved, once approved you may then
continue to grow. In addition, there is only one level 10 in any one influence per nation. The
RST may restrict no more than one level 9 per Influence in his/her region. If you want the top
spot, fight for it. 
Steal
Only the top-most rating of a target's Influence may be taken with Steal. To Steal an
Influence rating from another target, the character must spend 1.5 times the number of
unopposed actions as the target could have made with the influence. For example, a
character trying to Steal a target's Media of 4 would have to spend 15 unopposed actions of
Steal ((1 + 2 + 3 + 4) * 1.5 = 15). When enough Steal actions are accumulated, the target's
Influence drops one level. A number of Growth actions equal to twice the number of actions
that could have been made with the lost level are applied to the Influence of the character
using Steal.Using the above example, the victim's Influence drops to level three, and the
character using Steal gains 20 Growth actions into her own Media Influence. Steal is
cumulative over time and banks like Growth. 
Destroy

Only the top level of a character's Influence may be affected by Destroy. To Destroy
another target's Influence rating, the character must spend a number of unopposed Destroy
actions as the target could have made with the influence. For example, to Destroy a level 6
Health Influence requires 21 unopposed Destroy actions (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21). Unlike
Growth and Steal, Destroy actions are not banked and carried over from month to month. If
the target Influence is being guarded by Protect actions, your endeavor will not be
successful without additional actions(see Protect below). 
Give
Give actions allow one character to give another character their top level of an Influence.
This action costs the character twice the number of actions that the top level of their
Influence allows in a month (ignoring the levels below it). Thus, to Give a Police Influence of
4, the player must spend 8 actions (4 * 2 = 8). When these actions are successfully spent,
the Influence of the character using Give drops one level, and a number of Growth actions
are applied to the Influence of the receiving character equal to twice the number of actions of
the Influence level. In our Police example, the Influence of the character using Give drops to
level three, and the receiving character gains 20 Growth actions into her own Police
Influence. Only one level may be affected with Give per category per month per character. 
Block
Block actions prevent everyone from making specified Influence actions. It reduces all actions
of the type specified by the amount of actions invested in Block. For example: Clarice invests
3 actions to Block "get a Blood Trait" (as listed in the Health Influence). Now anyone that
month attempting to get blood has three actions subtracted from their action. If the adjusted
total is less than what is needed to achieve the effect, the effect fails. If more than one
character is investing in the same Block effect, the result is the effect of the highest Block
spent. To clarify, Block actions are not cumulative. Block is very powerful but specific. You

          3 = TRACE who's getting all of my blood!?! 
          3 = Alter Medical records of the Malkavian Lula at Child's Memorial
The Storyteller tracking Influence will be looking at the actions of all the characters in the
domain, and the Influence being used in the domain while accounting for all that happens. 
In the case of getting blood, Bob gets 2 blood because Clarice blocked one of his actions.
Clarice will not know who is still stealing from the blood banks around the city but may get a
clue towards it. Bob is going to find out about Lula's files being changed but not who. He may
also learn that his opponent is growing. If Bob next time decides to Trace both the blocking of
getting his blood and the Altering of Lula's medical records, he will meet with resistance on
the block (because of Conceal) but the medical record change (no Conceal) will bring him
closer to the core of Clarice's Influence. Perhaps this would even set him up to Steal.

chapter 4 special actions supp 5.0
Prime Chapter Four
Influence (4.0)
The rules for Influence in the Mind's Eye Theatre source books are too static to make their
use intriguing in a national or global chronicle. For the purpose of The Camarilla's
Sanctioned games, use the following rules instead. If these rules prove too cumbersome, a
Domain Storyteller may decide to only use what is in the Mind's Eye Theatre source books,
and keep Influence levels in her domain under seven (7). 
For the Camarilla sanctioned game, we are not using the Military or Espionage influence
that was introduced in Laws of the Hunt. 
Resources and influence are not interchangeable. Players cannot utilize influences to gain
vast sums of money for their characters to spend. Any financial dealings using influences is
represented by the influence actions as detailed below and cannot be converted into useable
funds. All cash acquisitions from influences are detailed in the Minds Eye Theatre books. To
gain high monthly incomes and spending money, characters need to purchase the
Resources background. 
There is an Influence Program that can track and run Influences for a 100+ member
domain. The Program works only upon PCs. It is a self extracting executable. It is located at:
http://www.greatbasin.net/ kindred/vamp_v100.exe 
Characters buy starting influences as outlined in the source book(s) appropriate to the
character's venue (see Introduction). Characters are limited to starting with an initial rating of
5 in any given influence although they can acquire more influence in the game, to an
absolute maximum of 10 in any one influence. Characters may use experience to purchase
additional levels of Influences, but are still subject to the less than level six in a category cap. 
All characters are limited to having no more levels of total Influence than the sum of their
maximum base Physical, Social and Mental Traits. Example: Gary Glasswalker, a Garou, has
8 Phys, 9 Social, 12 Mental Traits and maximum of 13 Traits in a category. His total number
of Influences he may have is 39. He decides to spend experience to get his Influence to
Church 5, Finance 4, Industry 5, Transportation 5, Police 5, Bureacracy 5, Underworld 5 and
Street 5. For Gary to get a Street 6, he will need to lose a level in one of the other Influences.
A character's rating in an Influence allows the character a certain number of actions per
month, in accordance with the chart below.

Rating is the level that the character has at the beginning of the month. Actions is the
number of Influence actions that level gives the character in a single month. Cost to Next is
the number of Influence actions required to grow that Influence to its next level (see
GROWTH). 
Using Influence (4.1)
A character may attempt any of the actions in the Mind's Eye Theatre source books by
informing the Storyteller tracking Influences of the number of actions spent. You may only
attempt actions listed in the Mind's Eye Theatre book if you have that level of Influence
necessary. Example: Bob has Level 2 Underworld which gives him 3 actions in a month. Bob
wants to Obtain an SMG (a 3 point action.) Though Bob has 3 actions he may not take that
action until he has Level 3 Underworld. Example 2: Bob has Underworld 5 now. (He is slick
that way.) Bob wants to attempt a Health action (Get a Blood Trait) but finds that he must
have Health Level 1 to take that action. 
A character or group of characters may not invest more than 50 actions in total toward any
one influence action. Additionally, the character may also attempt any of the following types

skills and object creation
The skill would be the center of the whole setup.  As each level progresses
higher and higher so to will the possible quality of the creation.  

There will be prototype objects of each level of quality corresponding to each
level of the skill.  The player should have a list of possible prototype
objects that can be created, possibly with the materials they carry only.  

Perhaps with the tools, facilities, and materials present, the player can type
their appropriate skill and recieve a list of objects producable, with the
appropriate time and materials needed.  

Variables would be final quality (ie value or quality level improved or
reduced depending on the resultant skillroll) and approximated time required
working to complete the task.  

The player can halt a project, but only be able to work on one project at once
or only one per skill level.

perhaps there is a biological factor to psionics
some sort of micro-organism which acts as a symbiot
and empowers the individial with psionics

spell idea-ressurrection variant
ok cast a spell on a corpse to keep it from decaying. and cast a variant of
ressurrection and put a different spirit into the body.

spell might need to be restricted to PC corpses only and is not a very 
pure and untainted thing to switch spirits and bodies around.

if any mob was used people would like to kill divas and dragons and take their corpse to capture it and then there would be a virtual invasion of the body snatchers.

or people messing with spirits and capturing them to use as slaves in the body
of a friggin treewee or something.
