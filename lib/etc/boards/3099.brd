&cRFirst Printing Announcement!&c0
It is I Spiralus!  

Alright, enough pomp from me, I have completed work on my first publication
using the dwomax inscribing machine.  This machine is very wonderous, take my
word for it, It is capable of reproducing the work of a hundred scribes
writing with both hands!  

Now, be an intrepid individual and try out this new invention, with the First
Printing of Spiralus's Librette!  A book I plan to print en mass every month,
containing usefull trivia and humorous politics.

Please....
Before posting anymore messages on this subject, I beg you to re-read my
previous post.  This mud was not built for you or me, or anyone outside the
circle.  This Mud is deticated for a select few to have their fill of RP'ing.
And as for updating, improving, and fixing stuff, beleive it or not, they are
still doing that.  Garadon is in the middle of MAJOR changes and just about
everyone is still working on new zones.  Remember these people do have lives.
If you think the mud could be better, download a stock code, re-write it to
match this one, 4 years later after failing you will be happy to come back to
this mud, even though it may have a max of 5 hits a day at times.  Ps.  Watch
out for the Zeplen.

Eh..
I'm not meaning to blame anyone because no one is on here...  But you are
right about how this is a MUD is not finished and very public.  The question
is, is this MUD ever going to be "finished"?  Just to a point where it would
attract more people to play.  That is where I am concerned.  If no one plays,
no one is really going to want to try to improve anything on here.  Or
vise-versa.

Why?
Why feel bad to see no one on?  Its been like this for a very long time.  Not
since it used to have some of the stock zones left in it have I seen a good
number of vistoms er people on here.  This Mud, you have to realize, is not
finished yet or really open to the public.  This mud was build so Garadon and
friends could get together and do some good ole Roleplaying, but times change,
people move, lives get more complicating and being able to come on for any
amount of time while they have another life out there can be difficult at
best.  Want fun?  Start RP'ing something, talk to mobs if you have to.  I hear
there are 1000 levels, try to be the first to reach that mark or something.  
But don't blame us for not finding the time to log on for anyone elses
enjoyment.  Peace.
