After the riot in newhaven several commoners were hired to bury the dead in
the park.  Spiralus took this chance to pose as a sympathetic helper so he
might steal the body of the dwomax councilmember and succeeded after getting
the other helpers drunk afterwards.  He snuck back to the burial sight and
recovered the entire corpse in stealth and left town unhindred.  

Spiralus was last seen at the time of the rioting.  

Also Emoka the murrash exile entered Erkalla and managed to clumsily gain
Arkady and Dryalus's attention regarding one of them being the recipient of a
mercenary service token.  Neither accepted or noted that the token is from the
Rough Riders and not Emoka himself.  Emoka left under escort by Mckenna the
battlerager.

Council member
The human council member was tried by Derrick and Tybolt and charges were dissmissed.  She went free.
Draylus was captured by the Grand Anti Palandin of Erkalla and tortured for a time.  He was fitted with
a runed stone in his forehead, and given the eyes of an Anti Paladin, and then released.  The stone was
supposed to take away his rune abilities as he used them.  Some time afterward, Draylus confronted and attacked
Tybolt, who killed him.  Arkady took the stone, and Tybolt took the body.  It is commonly known that Draylus
is burried in Callista, but this is not the case.

Thoarn stayed in Newhaven until today, expecting to be given guard of
councilman Allian Lightfoot.  He and three other elves of Mindar escorted
Allian out of Newhaven, but were immediately attacked at the gate by
Nikea, Derrick, and a company of assassins.  Allian and the other guard
were killed; Thoarn was taken captive by Nikea.

Nikea is now aware of Thoarn's parentage.  Her intentions are unknown.

Recently there was an uprising in Newhven, orchestrated by Derrick 
Devonshire.  He falsified records to indicate that the watch 
guards were stealing tax money.  When confronted with this, a 
riot was instigated and with the help of Tybolt, the council 
was ousted.  The dwomax member was killed, the human is in 
prison, and the elf is in the temple waiting to be rescued.  
Newhaven is under the protection of a "mercenary group" that 
belongs to TOOC, but people don't know that.  Derrick will 
likely been elected to city leader.
On another front, Tybolt went to the astral and secured the 
assistance of a Deva and some of his friends to attack Erkalla 
and rescue Mourn.  The whole while Bliss is fighting to figgure 
out what to make of these not so good, not so bad people.

obviously, and are from the perspective of the person who writes them.  If
anything is wrong, mail them and ask them to correct it instead of posting
about it on this board, otherwise it's bound to get spammy.  Thanks.
