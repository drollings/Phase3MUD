&cRSpiralus' First Writing&c0 draft number 1
Here be it, the first writing ever produced using the Dwomen book printer.  
After several months of deliberations, negotiations, and reparations the
Dwomax of the remote port of Orca's Inlet have completed a machine so
incredible that it surpases normal explanation.  My human fellows have mocked
me for my efforts to create a device that could create only mundane text and
not any of the more popular magical forms of inscribament.  But unlike them, I
can see nonmagical writing emerging from the private journals and poetry books
of individuals to the widespread sharing of magnificent works otherwise
forgotten in some rich baron's liquor room.  Oh, we shall see what lies ahead.


Although this writing is not intended to convey any particular fact, it will
describe the intentions of my future works.  In each I will report the things
I have learned about individual locals, be it a thriving city, an infested
dungeon, or a small tribe in a forgotten wilderness.  I also plan to simply
focus into a specific subject such as those races, intelligent or bestial,
Dieties loving or sadistic, or magics natural or arcane.  I will never pretend
to be all-knowing or omniscient, so be forwarned, these writings may give you
ideas but you, the reader, must always think for yourself.

Ryshiga concept
Ive already started building this city, so before I get to far in doing so I might as
well post the history to make sure they are no conflicts, seeing how I 'borrowed' a lil
bit from Final Fantasy. Here it goes...
     After the human race won its freedom, many still feared future reprisal and fled
to an island/small continent east of the main continent. BTW, the location isnt all that
important to me. Anywho, they discovered this new land, which is covered by rain clouds
practically year-round. Kinda like Seattle. They also came across the ancient dragon
Vree, who controlled the land. He granted the humans to right to live there, in return
for his protection, as he rests within his mountain almost eternally. He taught the humans
a lesser form of dragonic magic, as well as a specalized form of combat. The humans divided
these abilities into two ranks, the magically infused Dragon Knights, and the enhanced
soldier class of Dragoon. The city-state of Ryshiga was thus founded.
     Thousands of years ago, a long forgotten battle ensued between the ancient dragon
Vree and his rival, the dragon Karas. Being a personal battle, the rest of the dragon race
decided to remain neutral. The two dragons knew that they were completely equal in power
and would be unable to kill the other, so Karas and Vree gathered forces of monsters in
hopes of gaining the upper hand. However, the ensuing battle ended in a standstill, and
the weakened Vree and his remaining forces fled to the east while Karas to the west.
Vree retreated to Mt. Ryshi, the wounds so great he is forced to stay is a deep sleep
almost constantly. Due to this, the monsters who were once in his ranks became wild and
infested the island.
   When the humans arrived, Vree taught them the neccesary skills in order to effectively
slay the monsters on the island, as well as to defend him against another onslaught at
the hands of Karas. Needless to say, both the Dragoons and Dragon Knights are very skilled
in slaying dragons and large beasts. 
    Other citizens became very skilled sailors, and Ryshiga quickly flourished through
trading. The most important structures of Ryshiga are the respective barracks of the Dragoons
and Dragon Knights, and another fortress which is the only entrance to Vree's domain and
is extremely well-guarded. The government consists of an elected group of 4, although 
Ryshiga doesnt place much emphasis or importance of a government. Most everything is controlled
by the four clan-like divisons, the dragoons, dragon knights, the as-of-yet unnamed priesthood
and the merchants. Of course, Vree's occasional mandate is absolute, as the citizens still
view him as the lands true owner.
    Im hoping to make it so that both the Dragoons and Dragon Knights are 'true' classes,
both with new abilities and magic one can only attain through the guilds. However, if Im
allowed to do that, these new abilities would take extensive training and be very hard to
attain. I also wanted it to be placed a new continent entirely rather than an island, so
I could do more myself without having conflicts. One thing at time though.
By all means, let me know what u think.

Masada history
Years before the human revolt, a small band of human slaves numbering less than 100 slayed
their elven masters and escaped, traveling to the Masadian badlands where they knew the
deadly climate prove a valuable asset against the pursuing captors. They discovered the large
mountain, and hastely built into it. The sides were already too steep to climb, with the
only trail leading to the top too narrow for a large group. Dwomax engineers, knowing that
an outpost in an area close to elven civilization was invaluble, aided the newly freed humans
in excavating the mountain, and creating a system for which water and other necessities 
could be protected from the elements.
     Despite the harsh enviroment, the vindictive elves quickly organized a small garrison of 
troops to hunt down the escaped humans. Drastically underestimated the humans skill and resources,
the troops were literally slaughtered mercilessly. The elves surrounded the fortress, hoping
to drive them out. Again, they drastically underestimated the humans resources. 
It wasnt long before the elves gave in, the casulty ratio being more than 50 to 1. They
created a series of outposts and forts around the badlands, with the hopes of preventing
the freed humans from leading more revolts in elven territory, as well as to prevent anyone
from escaping to Masada. Regardless, it wasnt long before Masada became a haven for the
less reputable.
    From the start of the revolt, the first masadians were led by a nameless slave, known
for wearing the skull of his former master as a mask during battle. His knowledge for warfare
as well as his viciousness brought him obedience from his people, although he cared greatly
for their wellfare. During the elven raids, he gained himself the name of Skullbuster by
splitting the heads of elves cleanly with his sword, in addition to the mask he wore. This
title was inherited five times, under their kingship Masada managed to prosper. However,
the various rogue elements inside Masada's walls began to gain more and more power, and
while the Skullbusters have allowed them to operate in their city they did limit their activities.
      The most powerful of the the criminal cartels was a man known as Mahkmir, who dealt
in pretty much any activiy that could make him wealthy. He assassinated the ruling Skullbuster,
killed all known relatives and usurped his assets. Masada remains an ungoverned city, although
the present Mahkmir, with the title of Sultan, occasionally asserts a mandate or two if
needbe. The fortress itself is divided in power by the guilds, the cartels, and the Sultan
Mahkmir, who basically control their own space and businesses. Businesses can be owned
by people unaffliated with the above mentioned, although the space they operate in is leased
through them, since space is limited in such an ideal location it is rare for them to sell
it outright.
     BTW, the character i played named skullbuster claimed to be the successor to the throne
so to speak. Even though when i played him I had yet to build Masada, the background story
I created for him fits into this theme anyway. Ill write the background for him when the
recreate bug gets fixed, when I can actually play as him again. Man, this is a long post.

Cedar
This person of mystery entered the lands surrounding newhaven to find himself
amidst events much larger than himself.  In looking for a way to maintain his
individuality and freedom, he avoided contact with many.  His preference for
solitude and meditation reflects in his intense devotion to Pelendra.  
Specifically his unique form of priesthood.  Greenwood followers of pelendra
have taken a oath of lifelong devotion to protection of nature and plants.  

One of the interesting quirks of this hermit is his odd form of mutism.  
Confounding both him and his audience when he attempts to describe something
and not appear like lassie.  He spent some time learning how to speak in a
form of sign language that anyone could understand, not an easy feat.  Aside
from his interation with the fauna of the world, Cedar as he is called, is
known to kneel down and gesticulate to the plants around him.  Some say he
really can speak with plants, and those close close to him are known to laugh
aloud at the mention of him being mute.  Is he?  If not then what could have
driven him into silence?  

Cedar's interaction with people is odd to say the least, prone to random
attacks of berserking rampages through the streets.  Or a possibly
philantropic festival of melons being dropped all over town for passerbys to
sample.  In an almost naive manner, he'll follow anyone anywhere, tagging
along like a burr on one's clothing.  His chaotic behavior has led him into
the welcome arms of The Order of Chaos where he's enjoyed his fellows, but
sometimes he's ran into conflict.  His interactions had led him to befriend
some rather unusual figures, usually boisterous and lawbreaking men.  And when
tooc and the individuals met, tooc usually slew the men.  Is this insolence,
going against the order of chaos?  Or is Cedar being the gadfly on the horses
ass?  

Cedar's strongest romantic attachments are quite odd, a large rhodedendron
plant gets his attention always, the dryad in erkalla has received a few gifts
but they have not engaged in conversation.  Cedar was last known by tooc
members to have left on a voyage.  His ship meager, filled with clay pots of
rich soil, and a crude wooden distillery to cleanse saltwater.  His weapons,
the finest tooc could offer, his armor a mixture of shadow plate and holy
armor of pelendra, spiked and gilded ornate.  He has not returned to tooc in a
long ass time.  

Cedar takes his name from his appearance, his Greenwood devotion to Pelendra
has altered his physiology to that of a western red cedar.  His skin grew into
an armorlike bark, green in the palms lips and feet and other sensitive areas.
He has been bald ever since his first appearance.  It seems that as Cedar grew
in skill and devotion he was able to manipulate his floral properties; growing
roots in his feet to absorb nutrients, grafting plants for camoflauge and
company, growing nodules and thorns over his knuckles and so on for combat
enhancements.  His physical appearance is usually wearing only meager
clothing, a loincloth.  Always with equipment such as ice climbing boots,
grapples, a huge coil of rope slung over his shoulder.  Dual wielding
machettes and throwing axes are his favored weapons although he has
experimented with gladiator fighting, spiked armor combined with a hand to
hand fighting technique.  This is his darkest side, animalistic combat, biting
clawing choking twisting breaking limbs rending and mauling.    

That's cedar, I haven't created much RP for him.

Vree mark 2
A physical description of Vree, throughout her various stages.  Thought any
extra info might be helpful.

Thief:
She had short black hair and leaf green eyes, and walked with the light-
hearted grace of an elf still in love with the world.  She was rather young
(for an elf) to be out in the world, but still mature.  For clothes, she
was typically garbed in dark greens and black, and wore a combination of
leather and finely woven elven silks.  At her side was her Moonblade, as
always; silvery-bladed, simply wrought, with a single luminous moonstone
set in the pommel, and its hilt wrapped in black leather.  She always had
a ready smile, and her eyes were alight with youth and mischief.

Ranger:
Her hair had grown out to mid-back length, and she typically bound it back
into a tight braid to keep it out of the way.  Her eyes were somehow darker
green, the color of a shadowed forest leaf, and were more somber.  Her step
remained graceful but had an added purpose to it.  Now her clothes were
completely well-worn leather, and the colors were more green and grey.  Of
course the Moonblade was still at her side, the black leather bindings on
the hilt worn and faded to grey.  More often than not she would be found
with a pensive expression on her face, lost in thought, and an abiding
sorrow shone in her eyes.

Vampiric:
Her long black hair, once bound neatly, now hung loose about her shoulders.
Sometimes it would completely obscure her dark green eyes, with their glint
of red shining from the depths.  Her skin, pale already from time spent
underneath the canopy of leaves, approached a bleached-white pallor.  No more
green for her wardrobe, now she dressed entirely in shades of grey and
black, and often seemed not to care about the state of her clothes.  The
Moonblade hung by her side as it always had, but the pommel stone seemed
dimmer and gathered light rather than shining in it.  She usually kept the
hood of her night-black cloak up, to hide her sensitive eyes from the harsh
light of the sun, and to hide her haunted, pained expression from those
who still sought to call her "friend."

Wow.  I went more in-depth than I had planned.  Ah well.  She was my
absolute favorite character and still is.  :)

Hope it's helpful.

Vree mark 1
Let's see.  Vree Magaly.  Of house Magithergaly, she left the forest that
was her home to see the world and be a thief.  She was very naive and
unworldly, but fell among friends (of sorts).  I don't remember the very
early stuff, but I remember the Mourn stuff.  There was a kind of courtly
love thing going on, he would help her out and she would follow him around,
that kind of thing.  This went on for a good long while.  Somewhere in there
Mourn disappeared (?) (was this before or after Kravshera?) and the demon
event happened.  That was when Vree remorted for the first time and chose
Ranger as her new vocation, swearing to slay Kravshera for what he had
'done' to Mourn.  I believe it was around that time that Mourn disappeared
and then somewhere around mid-level Ranger for Vree, he reappeared and it
became slowly apparent that something was not right, and he was changed.
I think it was while he was away that Talin entered the picture (Tim, help
me out here)...  She saw Talin as a friend, he saw her as a love interest,
she and Talin were both devoted to good.  Mourn came back Wamphyri, and at
first appeared to be fighting the evil within.  Vree pledged herself to help
him in this internal struggle.  I think he disappeared again for a short
while (?) and when he returned again, the Wamphyri was ascendant.  This set
Vree (a strongly devoted goodly Ranger) dead against Mourn, to her sorrow.
Also, set Talin against him.  But Vree still loved Mourn.  Somewhere around 
here, Mourn killed Talin.

Vree couldn't pardon Mourn's evil acts any more; she couldn't stand to be
in love with someone who had been possessed of evil, who was a twisted 
reflection of the man she had known.  In the end, it came down to Vree
challenging Mourn to the death, at the Temple.  It was actually a fairly
long fight.  In the end, of course, Mourn prevailed and Vree was brought
to the edge of death.  Mourn offered her dying soul a chance at a twilit
life as a vampire, and Vree's weakened heart could not resist him or his
charms.  She drank of his blood and became his undead thrall--a bane for
the nature-loving, vitally alive elf.

(It was at this point that she of course remorted as Wamphyri)

Because she had no actual parasite, there was a darkened side of her but
no evil intellect battling her for control.  There was only her darkly
sinister master, Mourn, and his ascendant leech.  She spent a twilight
existance hating herself and the position she was in, but unable to do
anything about it because Mourn controlled her actions and felt her
thoughts.

Now that I think about it, I think it was maybe Trellic who died while
she was a ranger, and Talin who was killed after her vampirization.  Again,
someone help me out with this.

Finally, things got to a head.  Mourn brought Vree and her Moonblade to
Elinoth, to his graveyard, to look one final time at the gravemarkers of
all their friends, now passed by Mourn's blade.  He showed her a new marker,
she read her name upon it, and Mourn slew her.  Hungering for some release,
Vree offered no existance.

However, she did one last act: instead of bestowing upon her blade a power,
she cast her own soul and intellect into the Moonblade, thus escaping her
doomed body and whatever hell awaited her.  No one can touch the Moonblade,
for only a descendent or relative of the previous bearer, or some other elf
designated by the previous bearer, can do so without harm.  So the Blade
remains where it was left, plunged into the earth above her husk of a body
at her gravesite in Elinoth.

I know I probably fuddled some events and some timelines.  Help me out.

Sounds great to me.  Let me know when you've got your autobiography and intro
written up and I'd be happy to help you get it put into ...  Production.

Basically the first section is going to be an into, who spiralus is why he's
writing, and what's he up to now.  

Races described would be logical before going to specific zones, and also
groups and power figures.  

Each individual writing would be it's own book/scroll/librette.  And they'd be
categorized, like The Anthropoligisms and Anatomies of Murrash.  And
Anthropoligisms and Anatomies of Elves.  

Basically books on races (perhaps monsters), locals, groups and individuals,
and quests.  

I think I'll combine the autobiography into a beginner's handbook, followed by
a tour of Newhaven.  

Race books would follow, I can only work on racial archetypes and appearance.
I will need assistance on history in addition to the boards if possible.  

I'll have some work done soon, I'm focusing more on pictures now.
