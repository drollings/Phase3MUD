Unless you want me bastardizing an interpretation of your precious zones then
respond somehow.  

I am simply asking for info from the horses mouth, what you think is important
for RP with YOUR zone.  

Spiralus is going to make books, and if I don't have info, I'm just going to
poke fun at the wacky junk in a zone that's been left for dead.

This is it.
I think I've seen an irresistable reason to go largely Python.  ZODB is
the underlying object namespace underlying Zope, a popular web programming 
framework, and it very transparently manages SQL storage of Python objects.

It's stunningly cool.  If you want, check out some docs at

Need CS player!
Ok, on July 20-22 (i'm pretty sure those are the dates) in Bloomington MN (near the twin citys) there is going to be a big CS lan party.
The teams are either 5-5 or 6-6. We have 3 players and another trying to come, we need a fith person who can get down there and we need one BAD. There are $2,500 in cash money and if we are lucky enough to take First place we will qualify for the CPL. 
The cpl is some huge lan party down in florida a friend told me like all expences payed and stuff (really nice, lots of babes to).
Anyway, even if you cant ask around I really need another player.

A small step codewise...
I've gotten SFN Phase 3 running inside of a Python script.  It's not much.
The Python script is only a step beyond being an autorun script, merely
loading up the MUD as a shared library and handing control to it.  Now I've
got to design all the "wrappers" to allow Python and C++ to communicate
with each other.  Ugh.  It's not as easy as I thought it would be to 
get the languages in sync, especially as many of the routines that belong in
C++ access information that I'd rather keep in Python.  Ah well.  We'll
be doing good just to get Python worked in as a layer below the DGScripts
and usable for command tables, spells, and skills.

It would be better to get Phase 3.5 running with Python, but it's not 
running of itself yet.  Phase 3.5 has layers of abstraction that would
make it easier to get working with Python, but until then...

On a lighter note...
On July 20, 1969, as commander of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, Neil Armstrong
was the first person to set foot on the moon.  His first words after stepping
on the moon, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," were
televised to Earth and heard by millions.  But just before he reentered the
lander, he made the enigmatic remark: "Good luck, Mr.  Gorsky.  " Many people
at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut.
However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American
space programs.  Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what
the "Good luck Mr.  Gorsky" statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled.
On July 5,1995, in Tampa Bay, Florida while answering questions following a
speech, a reporter brought up the 26 year old question to Armstrong.  This
time he finally responded.  Mr.  Gorsky had died and so Neil Armstrong felt he
could answer the question.  

In 1938 when he was a kid in a small midwest town, he was playing baseball
with a friend in the backyard.  His friend hit a fly ball, which landed in his
neighbor's yard by the bedroom windows.  His neighbors were Mr.  And Mrs.  
Gorsky.  As he leaned down to pick up the ball, young Armstrong heard Mrs.  
Gorsky shouting at Mr.  Gorsky.  "Sex!  You want sex?!  You'll get sex when
the kid next door walks on the moon!  " True story.

Now _this_ is dirty.
The litany of Microsoft's foulness stretches beyond most people's memory
as it is, but we're getting a refresher.

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/06/21/1810258&mode=nested

Essentially, Microsoft branded GPL'ed open source software as 
"potentially viral" and forbids the use of any of it in the development
of a product that includes the SDK.

Pinheaded managers everywhere are going to require their developers to
use Microsoft's SDK.  In turn, those developers will be legally bound not
to use gcc to compile C and C++ programs that in any way use the SDK, not
to use StarOffice or <insert text editor here> to edit any files related to
it, and the list goes on.  Microsoft has misrepresented the GPL to arouse 
fears that even using a GPL tool to process information makes that information
subject to the GPL.

If a company ever tried something like this with things the average joe
understood - for example, if the power company made appliances and legally
bound you not to use their competitor's appliances in your home - the crack
down would be swift.

Ignorance is bliss.

We're only talking about control of the communications technology that will
become more pervasive and essential in coming years.

occupations
Okay, I was under the impression that occupations were going to be scripted by
the builders.  

I'd still like a chance to discuss this idea of mine, I believe it can handle
several aspects of gameplay in a constructive manner.

993824133
Keep in mind...
The occupations are what your character does automatically while you're away.
In many cases, we'd just be reporting outcome when they log back in by 
showing their income, expenses, incidents of note (luck rolls and such),
and possible random penalties based on character flaws.  For example, 
some characters might have a weakness for wenching and won't have so much
money left over... :)

Here's a suggestion
Instead of the previously mentioned idea of having social RP status given to
players on an individual basis, Why not have a system that coordinates certian
RP actions?  

Currently, if someone says they're the sherrif of newhaven, then people have
to deal with that somehow.  With a system we could have ratings and also a
means to affect and interact with other people's different ratings.  

The White Wolf influences system for the mind's eye theatre has a great system
for these RP situations.  Converting it for the Mud would not require creating
a new system, just the different "influence" abilities for this setting.  

With this system, people can choose a trade like blacksmithing, ranching,
fishing, merchant, or what have you, and not have to actually repeat the
process of chopping a tree down and selling it over and over.  More important
things can be focused on, and yet this aspect of gameplay is not ignored.  

Also within this system there can be order within different heirarchies such
as religous groups, the ruling court, a city's law or crime aspects.  A
powerful criminal can try using their skill's rank to arrange for an assassin.
A member of the law enforcement can arrange to have someone arrested or
framed.  A beaurocrat can make an attempt at embezzlment.  

If two people have a merchant skill, one can attempt to block the other's
business deals for a period of time.  Spying and sabotauge are possible, but
if you are a mere beginner in the scene, and you try taking on an experienced
player, success isn't likely, and being detected is.  

This system is normally ran once a month, with players learning what their
characters noticing the current trends in things.  Like a beginning Poacher
hears that an area has been terrorized by an unknown beast.  And a more
experienced poacher would learn that the beast is in fact a ranger protecting
some very valuble griffin eggs which have been orphaned.  

Players all decide what their efforts are going towards later that day.  
Everyone's actions are compared and the results sometimes emerge sooner than
the next month.  There is a program called grapevine that can handle hundreds
of players in the same system.  It is not open source, but the gaming rules
are very logical and based on a level to number of action points system.  
With actions being categorized so the whole thing runs smoothly.  

I'm creating a rough draft for possible Influence Abilites, I'm also working
on what sort of format and code would do the job.  I can see an interface for
this not being within the game, but at the login menu, with results also being
display there.

Another light bulb just went off
As you can tell, work is slack for me today.  I just had another idea.

Regarding the 3D worldspace that I've yapped about, here's my idea.  The
licensing of the V12 engine states that any game that you publish that you
use the V12 source for has to be published through GarageGames.  But what if
you aren't (yet) releasing clients?

What if the V12 engine here gets stripped down to maintaining a 3D worldspace
and runs just on the server, with hooks for Python to interact with it?  All
it would maintain then would be placement and movement.  Actual detailed
scripting would go through Python and C++ extensions.  By stripping out the
huge part of the engine that we don't need, we can realistically expand it
in other ways - we could make the world *HUGE*.

To boot, we'd gain all the physics handling we want, and when we do have the
infrastructure to display the world in 3D, we can release the client through
GarageGames. 

This sounds SWEET.

I've done it! (ideas, long)
I got the event driver wrapped into Python last night.  As a matter of fact,
I'd had the event driver correctly set up for a couple days, but my script to
test it was wrong.

Now I'm working on Python Material and DamageType classes, and I'm looking to
make their interaction as detailed as possible.  I also want to have all
material types have an object they become when they are "broken", described
according to their mass and type.  Also, DamageTypes should have very specific
effects on Materials.

Kenny and I had a discussion a couple days ago and it was highly productive.
The major thing that we discussed was steering this MUD into the direction of
a world sim.  We intend to make rooms into named areas placed into an actual
3D space; everything is going to be using double-precision floating point
coordinates, which is the key to having a real 3D environment.  Now, the
representation of it will be (initially) textual.  We're going to retain our
descriptions, and they will in some cases be shown based on proximity.
Certain things on the landscape become landmarks, seen from a distance, and
you can just type "go landmark" to set your character walking there.
Maps have a role in this as well; they can place certain landmarks effectively
for you to follow, given good direction sense or maybe a compass or a sextant.
Cartography will be a valuable profession.

Speaking of professions, we're going to start where "rent" and "inns" left off
and create all kinds of places where you can quit, and effectively leave your
character occupied doing something.  You could find employment, allowing for a
source of income based on some kind of trade skill; you can check in at a
guild hall to train or be trained (money flowing accordingly), or you could
hitch a ride with a caravan or a ship and go somewhere.  Some professions
might require that your character remain present in the world; we need to
address possible lethality in these cases.

I think that this is a good, realistic target for us.  Having a world that is
represented in 3D is a good idea; it's where we're headed anyway.  My guess is
that given proper design, both graphical and textual interfaces can be
supported on the client side; you are, after all, directing a character, not
One final thing: persistence.  No more zone resets, unless you really want
them.  We're going to store the state of things in a SQL database that gets
updated in real time; see moebius.bofh.net.au for an outline of this.
We're going to redesign around actual systems that generate mobiles, rather
than spontaneously dropping them in, as appropriate.

I think we've got a vision here that we can work towards.  I'm seeing some
big payoff ahead from the decision to work with Python and SQL.  Let's put
it this way; I can make a whole new material type right now with the simple
statement Mithril = Metal("Mithril"), and set a few new variables on it
to set the properties.  This could be done from inside the MUD or outside,
and no reboot would be required.  The new material type would register
itself and automatically become available in OLC.  It's damn cool. ;)

Thoughts?

Python MUDs: findings thus far
While there's a lot a talk of Python usage in MUD programming, I've only found
a few Python engines as of yet.  

The first one I spotted, Moebius, certainly has some potential.  I got it
working last night after a while, but it's definitely in early beta.  It isn't
using the latest libraries for Python, and crashes presently.  Also, in my
mind it relies too heavily on the SQL database.  SQL may be fast for data
retrieval, but it's still slow compared to accessing things already in memory.
I forsee timed snapshots of the MUD's state to a "live" database, but not what
I saw.  

Ah well, that can all be changed.  I also took a quick look at POO and PUB.  
The quirkily-named POO is a MOO implementation in Python.  This is
interesting, but not what we want.  MOO's are extremely hands on with the code
and each builder is essentially a programmer.  POO is more redeemable in that
you all would be using a language you could use for general purposes, but
we're not going to go there.  

PUB?  It was a simple MUD, and I do mean simple.  Nothing to write home about.

What I did see, however, was efficient socket coding where it is needed.  I
can see myself turning our present engine into a "World" module that can be
stopped and restarted without dropping connections, possible without even
disturbing the placement of creatures and objects.  Depending on how
close-knit we want to make Python and the DGScripts, we could even save script
variables to give DGScripts a lifespan hitherto impossible.  

There are a lot of possibilities here.  We'll be breaking new ground in MUD
development, though, by the looks of things.  

I like this trend.  ;)

Python progress
I'm only one step shy of getting a working Boost extension.  There's an
unresolved symbol - a subroutine that should be compiled into my shared
library, but is missing - that is stopping me.  

On the plus side, I've figured out how to make an object fully usable and
extensible from both the C++ and Python sides, interchangeably.  I still have
to figure out what to do with data structures, though.  Once something is
loaded into memory, it is necessary to make it visible to both sides.  For
example, I should be able to tell which mobiles are in which rooms in either
context, or else we don't get the speed benefit of C++ where it matters there.

More on this later.

Idea
Really, since we're technically levelless, perhaps we should clear up the
confusion and replace level with a reputation rating.  I guess those of us
that play Black and White would understand the context - the reputation can
be that of heroism or notoriety or just sheer power.

To satisfy Kenny's idea of reputations, we could have staff-written notes
on players of a given level describing what the general populace would know.

Re: blackcat
My concern for what BlackCat said upon visiting our under-construction MUD is
about nil.  There are those people that rank MUDs by player count.  I think
that much of what we've developed to date isn't immediately obvious to someone
who comes looking for more of the same, with a huge player base.  I want a
sizeable player count some day, but the audience we'll appeal to is the more
intellectual, in-depth crowd.  The hack and slashers will find themselves more
drawn to FPS games these days.  

I don't want to say that we'll be an RP-exclusive MUD.  We need to allow for
less intense, more immediately rewarding forms of play if we're going to get
the critical mass for the kind of RP and power struggles we want.  I believe
that we should compromise some of our difficult features (permanent death,
starvation, etc.  ) at least temporarily towards this end.

Progress!
As of today, I very nearly have the event driver wrapped up for use in 
Python.  I've got a few issues with the installation of the Boost libraries,
but I am presently creating shared libraries (like DLL's) containing what
we have.

From what I see, we'll probably want to repeat this process for all the 
classes at least up to the Scriptable (the base class that allows something
to interface with the DG scripts) that comprise our MUD base, as well as our
script processor and combat code.  We'll definitely want to keep our present
string and object stacking code, as well as the color code and the text
editor.  From there, things are still a little fuzzy in my mind.  However,
I'm very happy with what the Boost libraries are making possible.  They seem
to be the best solution I've found, requiring minimal modification to my
C++ code to work.

I'm still not sure how memory management is going to work yet, and I'm 
tempted to Pythonize things quite a bit for protoype loading.  I also want
an easier way to manage bitflags and constants, and that will definitely r
require some new C++ classes.  However, I expect this to breathe new life 
into this project.

I'm having fun with this. :)

I've found it!
I have before me the best way yet to implement Python as our glue language,
here.  The Boost libraries are C++ libraries written largely by members of
the C++ standard committee, and amongst them is Boost.Python, which is the
the most comprehensive and flexible framework I've seen yet for this kind
of work.

I'll use some simplified versions of the Phase 3.5 classes to implement
an API that Boost.Python can use.  That way, we can take advantage of our
existing code.  From there, more versatile relationships can be created
through Python.  

I will, of course, be focusing on the aspect of object behavior and 
generic interactions that should be equally usable in other frameworks
such as the V12 engine.

Just thought I'd let you all know. ;)

A coding experiment
Some of you already know of my growing fascination with Python.  Others haven't heard.

Python is a scripting language that is becoming more popular very rapidly.  It is object-oriented
and very cleanly designed.  A lot of knowledgeable people say that you can expect to code things
in Python in about a third of the time it would take to code it in C++, owing to the built-in
memory management.  It can also load modules of code into a running program on the fly easily,
and those modules can be written in C and C++ where you need the speed of a compiled language.

We're 100% C++ right now.  I'm a single developer.  I keep coming back to this old projec
because it's still a great outlet for my programming ambitions, but nobody else has been able
to consistently code for us except Kenny.  I spend a lot of my programming time here debugging,
and I'd like to make better use of what little time I have here.  This is the reason for my
current interest.

I'm looking for ways to wrap our present code into discrete modules that can be written into
Python.  I think it can be done, although I've used some features of C++ that aren't readily
ported to other languages and will have to insulate Python from parts of the code that use them.
Still, this is simple enough.

Whatever shape our next project takes, whether it is a continuation of what we're doing here
or something new, this is valuable research.  A scripting language would be great for gluing
together components, whether they're bits of code I've already written or readily available 
modules for SQL and XML.  

Does anyone have any comments?  Other than why the hell I never stop coding? ;)

If I were starting from scratch...
I know how I'd do it.  A mean, lean C++ core like what Phase 3.5 has
shaped up to have, a SQL database which loads zones on demand, 
an embedded Python machine for processing commands
and spell effects, our present DGScript system for general purpose
scripts, and everything linked up through a property system so that
you could attach and detach things like being an object container just
like you do scripts.

If we're going to make a transition to a V12-based project, I would
like to evaluate these technologies for the big move.

You know...
...  I've been thinking about the way we've had triggers set up and I've
realized that with a little tweaking, it has many of the advantages of an
object-oriented tree and more.  

Relic has been seeking suggestions for Homeworld 2, as they want to make it
more moddable and work with the more prominent mod teams.  I suggested that
they orient ship behavior around triggers, because there's a ton of
flexibility when you can just drop in a new script and have it work, even when
there are other scripts of the same trigger type already attached.  You can't
always get by with this kind of setup in the real world, but it sure works.  

I need a breath of fresh air in this project, or another one similar to it.  
I miss the advanced design we've done here, the extent of control we've had
over the design, the innovative approaches we've taken.

Making good scripts gooder.
So once again, boredom in class leads to dumb stuff.  I'd been thinking about
the script I made to sort a random amount of money into poker chips.  The
original method I used was rather brute-tastic.  It worked, and worked well,
but was hardly elegant.  I decided to rewrite and make things a little more
dynamic.  I'll post both here.  Note that the values of the various chip
colors were changed to facilitate dynamic chip loading.  I haven't tested the
new one yet, but you'll see what I'm getting at.    

**** OLD SCRIPT****
if %amount% > 40000000
    delay 5 give %amount% coin %actor%
    delay 7 say I can't convert this much at once.
    halt
else
load obj 15291
while %amount% >= 1000000
  load obj 15296
  eval amount %amount% - 1000000
done
while %amount% >= 100000
  load obj 15297
  eval amount %amount% - 100000
done
while %amount% >= 10000
  load obj 15298
  eval amount %amount% - 10000
done
while %amount% >= 1000
  load obj 15293
  eval amount %amount% - 1000
done
while %amount% >= 100
  load obj 15294
  eval amount %amount% - 100
done
while %amount% >= 10
  load obj 15295
  eval amount %amount% - 10
done
while %amount% >= 1
  load obj 15299
  eval amount %amount% - 1
done
delay 5 emote counts the money very carefully.
delay 10 emote assembles a stack of chips.
delay 15 put all.chip bag
delay 17 give bag %actor%
delay 18 drop all.chip
delay 18 drop bag
delay 20 say Thank you!
end
**** NEW SCRIPT ****
set factor 1000000
set chip 15293
if %amount% > 4000000
  delay 5 give %amount% coin %actor%
  delay 7 say I can't convert this much at once.
  halt
else
load obj 15291
while %amount%
  while %amount% > %factor%
    load obj %chip%
    eval amount %amount% - %factor%
  done
  if %amount% == 0
    unset amount
  else
    eval factor %factor% / 10
    eval chip %chip% + 1
  end
done
delay 5 emote counts the money very carefully.                                  
delay 10 emote assembles a stack of chips.                                      
delay 15 put all.chip bag                                                       
delay 17 give bag %actor%                                                       
delay 18 drop all.chip                                                          
delay 18 drop bag                                                               
delay 20 say Thank you!                                                         
end

Problem
I created a character named Tarrist.  I did some work on him in Damara's
Tomb.  I quit.

I tried to log back in as Tarrist the next day, and it acted as if he didn't
exist, asking me to create a new character with the name Tarrist.  I figured
it was a fluke, went ahead and did it, and did the whole Damara's Tomb thing
again.

Then, on a hunch, I saved and logged out.  I tried logging back in as Tarrist
and, sure enough, the damn thing had again forgotten that Tarrist existed.

What the hell..?  The MUD isn't saving new characters.  Is it saving changes
to existing characters?

Just something you guys might want to look into.  :)

underwater stuff
How should I handle underwater stuff?  

I was considering creating several items to allow breathing for a short
period.  These Items would be rechargable, in addition it seems like a script
would be needed for holding one's breath underwater.  

Is there anything else I should consider?  Swimming with a heavy load,
swimming up with a load, sinking from the surface.    

ideas on breathing equipment?

ascii and such
Yeah I've seen them also, there's ascii symbols instead of normal text.  

I don't remember the specific mobs with the ascii in their long descrip,
Magdalena, if you could put those up then they could see also.  

  
And how do you intentionally use ascii symbols? they could be usefull.

Trouble with extra descriptions
I have been having trouble with the extra descriptions menu in redit.
In attempting to write a description for a sign, I am usually disconnected or some sort of symbols are there instead of letters.

Masada mobs
Don't forget that, as you change these mobiles, that you have the advantage
now of being able to use the simple mob generator.  Switch medit to "simple"
mode and you can just punch in point values, class, and level, and it'll
generate the stats according to template.  If you're skeptical of the 
results, you can still use simple mode, save the mob to memory, then edit
it and switch to extended mode to nitpick to your heart's content.

masada
Ive 'fixed' the zedit errors, and havent seen any new problems. Im going to disconnect
Masada, seeing how the mobs need yet another revamp. Since Ill be focusing on Ryshiga
for the time being, anyone who wishes to add to Masada is welcome to do so. Sorry for
the headache rez.

Alright damn it.
Before you leave the damn MUD, reset the zone you were working on.  If it
generates a zone error frigging FIX it before you leave.  I'm sick of having
my screen spammed every time a zone resets around here.  Zedit is *NOT* that
difficult.  Anyone who is having a hard time understanding how it works, MUD
mail me right now and say "I need help," and I'll show you how to use it.

mootedness
I refuse to be mooted.  The mailed pictures would be the newer pictures with
having not been scanned would nullify the mootness of mailing them in the
postal manner.  The emailed pictures would also require being emailness due to
their lack of paper form in my posession.  I could print out the pictures and
mail them through the post office but that would be self-nullifying due to
your requiring them in digital copy and not the paper copy-type.

Scanner
I got access to one...  But wouldn't that point be moot, since you're going to
try to email me the pictures...  In which case, you'd already have scanned
them.

Instructions for email attachments
If they're over 5MB, chances are they'll come back. You'll probably need to compress them with a zip file maker, ALONG WITH converting them to a Jpg. If that doesn't work, I'll send you instructions on how to FTP them over to me.
